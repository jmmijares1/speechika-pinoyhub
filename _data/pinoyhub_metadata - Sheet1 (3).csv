Jed and Vit, Reel Advice:

""In My Life"" marks the return of Vilma Santos (aptly named the ""Star for All Seasons"") after a very long absence at the big screen. It also marks a rarity in Philippine cinema - starring two big league actors as gay lovers. With all the star power and all the hype, all seems well for ""In My Life"". But films can suffer a lot when people expect too much. Here's hoping that ""In My Life"" won't suffer the same fate that many films have taken. Read on if ""In My Life"" holds it weight in gold.

Shirley (Vilma Santos) is a single mom and public school librarian. When her daughter Dang decides to leave her to go to Australia, she decides to go to New York to stay with her gay son, Mark (Luis Manzano) as a getaway from all her problems. There, she tries to start a new life with the help of Mark's lover, Noel (John Lloyd-Cruz) while also trying to rekindle her lost relationship with Mark. But just as things are getting better for her in America, she finds out that her son and Noel are keeping a dark secret from her.

We really wanted ""In My Life"" to be one of the few films that we will always look back on and cherish as a film that brings a glimmer in our eyes. Unfortunately, that dream won't happen. So what made ""In My Life"" bad? First, it was definitely not the acting. We all have praises for the three main protagonists. Vilma was just at her best here and John Lloyd showed how much drama he can show out. Luis needs more improvement but he actually performed well being a homosexual so still, props to him. Second, it also wasn't the lack of drama thereof. There were oodles upon oodles of scenes where tears will fall and we also liked the occasional break from all the heaviness with light comedic scenes scattered all over the film.

Unfortunately, even with all the topnotch acting and drama, the simple truth is that ""In My Life"" left out one big aspect in a film and that is the story/plot. The story of ""In My Life"" was just too much for us to digest as there are a lot of unnecessary subplots happening all over the place (especially by the end of the film). As a viewer, we just wanted it to end but the film just gave more, more and more. We think the writers just forced it to have lots of dramatic avenues just for the sake that people will cry. As the saying goes, too much of anything is bad and this holds true here as they do not mesh well. Cry you will but you might also wonder why. Even though it had unusual twists, it will make you think if it was really necessary to have them happen that way as an effective means to move the story forward. For us, they were not.

To sum it all up, ""In My Life"" is still a wonderful experience and a film that people could enjoy. Sadly, it was not the hype that destroyed it - it just didn't have much direction in its storytelling and that hampered it into becoming a true blue masterpiece.

Cezeriza Valencia, PEP:

Veteran director Olivia Lamasan and screenwriters Raymond Lee and Senedy Que brings us a gem in Philippine drama: less tears but an absolute tearjerker; close to real life but richly plotted and unpredictable.

Vilma Santos plays the role of Shierly Templo, a sourly librarian suffering from empty nest syndrome, with her daughter Dang (Dimples Romana) planning to move to Australia with her family, and her estranged gay son Mark (Luis Manzano) living in New York. After a fight with Dang, she decides to visit Mark, only to be surprised that he is already living with another man named Noel (John Lloyd Cruz), an illegal immigrant.

In an attempt to win Shirley's approval and affection, Noel patiently chaperones her around the city and attends to her needs. After spending more time with her son's lover, Shirley realizes that she has become emotionally distant from her son and soon becomes jealous of Noel who seems to know Mark better now than her.

This gap deepened when Mark, despite Noel's coaxing, refused to tell his mother about his serious medical condition. As he is recovering from his illness, Shirley attempts to repair their relationship and the history of their mother and son relationship unfolds. But a dark cloud looms over them all and things will never be the same again.

For its exceptional casting alone, In My Life is amazing. Vilma aside, my heart goes out to John Lloyd, that rare dramatic actor who can make you cry just by seeing his eyes well up with tears. He portrays a lover quietly suffering Shirley's tantrums with restraint and grace, but at the same time, he makes it heartfelt and sincere.

I was surprised by John Lloyd and Luis' screen dynamic as a gay couple. They call each other as Babe, display very romantic photos in their apartment and as the movie ends, they share a tender kiss on Brooklyn Bridge. Onscreen, their love is sweet, hushed and terribly romantic; even more effective and memorable than most hetero screen pairings.


As for JLC and Luis being typecast in gay roles or catching social stigma, I have serious doubts about that, for onscreen, they are still as masculine and virile.


As for Vilma, she portrayed a multi-dimensional mother who learns to get off her high horse and deal with displaced motherly pride. Later in the movie, Shirley realizes that even if she's done everything for her children, she failed to know them as persons. Unlike other mother roles she has done in the past, the Star for All Seasons depicts a flawed mother who eventually finds peace with herself and her past mistakes.

Not to be missed is Shirley and Noel's confrontation wherein the traditional sampalan was reinvented and Noel throws in the lines: ""Anak mo lang siya, hindi mo siya pag-aari. Kung ano ang naging siya, dahil 'yon sa mga taong pumaligid sa kanya, at isa ka lang doon.""

Another highlight of the movie is the dance sequence of Luis with his mother. Currently the Governor of Batangas, Ate Vi has been very vocal in saying that she is passionate about dancing and apparently her son inherited this love as well.

The audience is also treated to the amazing sights and landmarks of New York City. With Mark, Shirley, and Noel, the audience experiences a slice of middle class life in the city that never sleeps. In My Life also has witty one-liners and refreshing comic relief in between dramatic moments, effectively delivered by Vice Ganda. We wish he had more exposure in the film.

mov002,RemingtonAndTheCurseOfZombadings_Poster.jpg,,,Remington and the Curse of Zombadings,Jaded Castro,2011-08-31,"Variety (Dennis Harvey):

Exuberantly silly, “Remington and the Curse of the Zombadings” sends up Filipino horror, romance, gaysploitation and other genre cliches in service of a pro-tolerance message. Despite that message, there’s very little political correctitude to be found here, and the willingness to ridicule everyone lends Jade Castro’s comedy a contrary, disarming guilelessness, suggesting only churls (of any political/sexual/moral persuasion) could be so humorless as to take actual offense. Released on home turf over two years ago, the pic has been kicking around festivals and elsewhere since, with recent limited U.S. theatrical launch raising visibility for a niche home-format release.

[...]

Holding this crazy quilt together to a large extent is Escudero, a teen pinup who surprises here (and has won some awards notice) with delightful farcical facility. His possessed-by-a-demon-of-camp act is a physical comedy stunt reminiscent of Steve Martin’s forced gender blur in “All of Me” and, as with all the stereotypes deployed here, it’s too good-natured to insult any viewer. Supporting players, some with established screen personas that add an in-joke layer, are all game. Inspiration occasionally flags a bit, but the pic’s friendly vibe compensates for its unevenness. Assembly is brisk and colorful.

LA Times (Annlee Ellingson):

“Remington and the Curse of the Zombadings,” the latter part of which translates from Tagalog to “gay zombies,” is an unapologetically goofy horror comedy about a Filipino boy who taunts the homosexuals in his town until a drag queen curses him. Fifteen years later, on the cusp of his 21st birthday, drunk, ne’er-do-well Remington (Mart Escudero) finds he’s experiencing a life change: a full body shave, purple lingo (literally, the subtitles for his new slang are in purple script) and budding feelings for his best bud Jigs (Kerbi Zamora). He’s gay!

Remington’s new identity wouldn’t be so bad in his community of fluid sexuality if it weren’t for the serial killer on the loose with a bona fide gaydar — and his drag-queen victims who rise from the dead. All of this is ridiculously silly, of course, with low-rent special effects to boot. But you may laugh despite yourself as Remington’s body and newfound desires betray a lifetime of bigotry.

Just as Remington is ready to give up and accept his new lifestyle, his loved ones encourage him to be true to himself — that is, straight. Mixed message or clever reverse? From a film that portrays women in positions of power and strength (the police force is all ladies), one suspects the latter.

Cinemalaya review: Coming out late in 'Bwakaw'
By Francis Joseph Cruz
Posted at Jul 31 2012 11:45 AM | Updated as of Aug 01 2012 03:13 AM
From: https://news.abs-cbn.com/lifestyle/07/31/12/cinemalaya-review-coming-out-late-bwakaw

Jun Lana started his career in film writing screenplays for directors Marilou Diaz-Abaya and Maryo J. de los Reyes, among others. In the several years when the country was starving for quality films, he penned films like Diaz-Abaya’s ""Sa Pusod ng Dagat"" (In the Navel of the Sea, 1998), ""Jose Rizal"" (1998) and ""Muro-ami"" (1999), tasteful alternatives to the crass titillating films that were being produced by the dozens.

Interestingly, ""Gigil"" (2006), Lana’s directorial debut, capitalized largely on babes clad in bikinis, parading both their bodies and loose morals in the beach. He then dabbled in various other genres, directing disposable horrors like ""Mag-ingat ka sa… Kulam"" (2008) and ""Tarot"" (2009) and sleazy dramas like ""Roxxxanne"" (2007) and ""My Neighbor’s Wife"" (2011) for various studios and producers.

The career of Lana became a prime example of initial promise gone wrong. His latest, ""Bwakaw,"" seems to be his belated apology for the misdirection of his career.

""Bwakaw"" is about Rene, a gay old man (Eddie Garcia) who only came out of the closet when he’s already very old and is now coping with the loneliness dealt by his delayed decision. The film is movingly sincere. Lana molds Rene not from stereotype but from accurate perceptions of how a man would be had he lived his life as a lie and decided only to admit his reality when he barely has any years left to enjoy it.

Garcia understands the specific nuances of the character he’s portraying. He does not pepper his portrayal with gags and cheap imitations. Instead, he allows his performance to be subtle and low-key, resulting in what essentially is a quiet triumph in acting.

Lana smartly plays Rene’s repulsion towards his friends and acquaintances as the core of the film’s humor. He also purposefully manifests Rene’s repressed guilt with a beautiful sideplot involving a failed romance. While the film’s depiction of an old man’s loneliness is already astute and affecting, it still forces more storylines than the film’s elegant pacing can manage. The result is a screenplay that is a bit too busy and a bit too lenient to the many contrivances in plotting.

The screenplay’s excesses are thankfully grounded by Lana’s surprisingly restrained direction. Set in San Pablo, the film remarkably incorporates a very provincial laidback appreciation of time, perhaps the only thing that both tortures and gives hope to the film’s impossible protagonist.

A less sensitive director would rush to forward the story, relish in the big dramatic moments, and exploit the storyline of the titular dog. Lana, on the other hand, allows the story to crawl, to stagger and earn the emotions that have been repressed by the abundance of silence and the occasional jokes.

Delightfully unhurried, ""Bwakaw"" manages to make stretches of quietude and nothingness both entertaining and meaningful. It also helps that the film’s images are composed, lighted and framed exquisitely. The music is sparse but elaborate, starting with light strumming of a native instrument before evolving into something more hopeful, following the eventual restoration of Rene’s faith in life.

The film’s final frame, a long shot of a street where Rene is walking as a former flame drives his tricycle by totally ignoring the old man, is painfully lovely. It depicts a life where fairy tale endings do not exist especially for people who are most susceptible to melancholy yet notwithstanding that, living it still seems to be the most gratifying choice.

Bwakaw: Toronto Review
BY DAVID ROONEY SEPTEMBER 16, 2012 6:33PM
From: https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/bwakaw-toronto-eddie-garcia-jun-robles-lana-370659/

A six-decade veteran of film and television in the Philippines, Eddie Garcia shows both hardened and heartwarming sides in Jun Robles Lana's tender film about old age and loneliness.

TORONTO – A captivating charmer from the Philippines, Jun Robles Lana’s Bwakaw charts the gently humanizing process by which a sour gay curmudgeon opens himself up late in life to experience love and loss. Elevated by a performance to be treasured from national screen superstar Eddie Garcia, and equally winning work from a cute pooch, the film gracefully blends melodrama, broad and lower-key comedy, and honestly earned sentiment while making poignant observations about old age, emotional solitude, romantic longing and friendship.

Following its Toronto exposure with a New York Film Festival main-slate slot, this could conceivably find a home in boutique arthouse distribution, with its chances improved by discreet trimming. As hits like The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel have demonstrated, the gray dollar is a mighty force, and there’s no reason that market couldn’t also be tapped by a foreign-language film from outside the usual travel-friendly territories. Bwakaw also suggests remake potential, though one fears that relocation to a familiar culture would render this lovely story more prosaic.

Crusty Rene (Garcia) lives in a village outside Manila, where he continues to perform janitorial duties at the local post office despite being officially retired. Routine and a sense of usefulness are important to this proud man, more so than cordial relations with colleagues or neighbors. Even the soft spot he clearly holds for Bwakaw, the sandy-colored stray mutt that adopted him, is cloaked in gruff indifference.

The dog becomes a contentious issue when tricycle taxi driver Sol (Rez Cortez) attempts to charge Rene an additional passenger fare for the animal. (It’s unclear whether this was a direct influence, but the clash mirrors the hilarious Luchino Visconti episode of the 1953 Italian portmanteau film, Of Life and Love (Siamo donne), in which hot-tempered Anna Magnani, playing herself, flares up over a Roman cabbie’s insistence that her pet is not a lap dog.)

Thuggy-looking, tattooed Sol becomes a regular target for Rene’s rudeness. But when Bwakaw falls ill, requiring frequent transportation to a veterinary clinic, Rene is forced to accept help, and the two men reach a truce.

While it’s revealed early on that Rene accepted his homosexuality at a relatively advanced age, there’s minimal sense of solidarity in his prickly friendship with Zaldy (Soxie Topacio) a flaming hairdresser also known as “Mother.” And Rene barely tolerates Zaldy’s zaftig trannie sidekick Tracy (Joey Paras), who bristles at the old man’s derision. Their insistence on sending over reluctant rent boys to soften up Rene earns them no gratitude. These scenes are played for high comedy, but Lana weaves them seamlessly into the narrative fabric.

One of the most affecting aspects of Bwakaw is the balance of comedy and melancholy as Rene ponders his mortality. Having snapped up a deluxe coffin during a summer sale, he is forced to accommodate the massive casket in his cramped home when the funeral parlor closes up shop. And he returns regularly to the church confessional, where Father Eddie (Gardo Versoza) keeps notes on who gets what in the will Rene is forever updating. Casting sensitive hunk Versoza as the patient priest seems a canny stroke from Lana to keep the audience guessing about where and how romance will surface.

Rene’s conflicted attitudes toward religion are explored with delicacy and humor, notably via the life-size Christ figure he inherited from his devout mother, which now reclines on his bed. There are also tender scenes of contrition and atonement with Alicia (Armida Siguion Reyna), a woman Rene strung along for 15 years without ever loving her. Alicia’s dementia lifts to reveal brief lapses of lucidity in some of the film’s most emotionally piercing scenes.

As Sol puts his carpentry and electrician skills to use, making improvements on Rene’s run-down home, and the fastidious old man attempts a more youthful makeover, Bwakaw appears headed in predictable directions. But Luna is more interested in the bittersweet subtleties of cumulative self-discovery than in artificially tidy outcomes.

Shot in a sedate style that benefits from the sleepy haze of the tropical light, the film makes economic use of a nonintrusive score to maintain its pleasurably mellow rhythm. While it’s 10 or 15 minutes too long, the unhurried feel seems entirely in keeping with the focus on a character taking stock in his twilight years. Garcia embodies that process beautifully, never forcing the evidence of vulnerability and pain beneath Rene’s abrasive exterior. And with an unassuming appeal that characterizes the experience as a whole, Bwakaw (played by Princess) joins the ranks of the most heart-tugging screen dogs.

Review: Bwakaw
By John Semley  on September 24, 2012
From: https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/bwakaw/

This oddball Filipino film effectively mints its own genre: the light dark comedy.

Rating: 3 out of 4 stars

This oddball Filipino film effectively mints its own genre: the light dark comedy. Lensing the life of a crotchety gay retiree, Rene (Eddie Garcia), living with his beloved dog, Bwakaw (Princess), in the Philippines, Jun Robles Lana’s Bwakaw is equal parts broad, sitcom-ish comedy and macabre gallows humor. If nothing else, it feels entirely, effervescently original.

Coming to terms with his homosexuality late in life, Garcia’s hunched hero is all kinds of frustrated. It’s implied that he’s never even been with a man (or a woman), grouchily refusing the boy-toy offerings of a local transvestite pimp (Joey Paras) while slowly forming a relationship with a gruff, straight, married cab driver (Rez Cortez). Indeed, the only man in Rene’s bed is a shrouded, life-size statue of Christ, which may be magical: a commingling of homoerotic desire and Catholic guilt that sums up Rene’s own fraught conception of himself. He petitions his priest, who pulls double duty as the executor of his estate, to pray for him, mediating his own ambivalent search for salvation. Drifting through his twilight years, Rene spends his days revising his last will and testament, sparring with the employees of the post office he used to work at (and, as he’s a creature of well-worn habits, still shows up to routinely clean and tidy), visiting an old girlfriend in an old-folks home, and palling around with his darling dog.

On paper, Bwakaw seems like a limp country-western song about a guy-and-his-dog movie. It’s anything but. Given Rene’s sad, unfulfilled love life, Bwakaw isn’t only his faithful companion, but an idealized object of all his pent-up romantic longing. Despite the dog’s affection, Rene’s love for the animal runs entirely one way: Bwakaw may not be able to provide Rene the love he desires from a human partner, but it can’t reject its master’s dotty affections. And unlike the girlfriends he treated unfairly and emotionally scammed through his own dishonesty regarding his sexuality, Rene doesn’t have to lie to love Bwakaw. So when the dog develops cancer, his owner is panicked in his desire to fix him up. It’s not only a confrontation with his own mortality, but with the sad reality of a lived half-lived.

The emotions running through the film are surprisingly and refreshingly rich, especially given the thicker attempts at comedy Lana indulges. As seriously as Bwakaw takes the issue of Rene’s own sexuality, it elsewhere treats the gay members of his small town as flamboyant and clownish. Perhaps their ability to be so flamboyant and clownish reveals the larger culture of acceptance in this backwater berg, a generous reading betrayed by the community’s skepticism of Cortez’s tough-looking cabbie. At one point, while turning down another svelte, apparently mute boy prostitute, Rene comments that he’s “not that kind of a gay man.” While the film is fairly diligent in probing the character’s lonely, delimited conception of his own sexuality, it also weirdly seems to place pride in his shuffling existence as a hard-nosed celibate, the weight of his exasperated desire his cross to bear.

If the sexual politics run a bit watery at times, it seems less a matter of bad faith than over-eagerness. With Bwakaw, it’s pretty clear Lana wants to make a film about big things, while also keeping everything brisk, bright, and pleasantly quaint. Thanks in large part to the sincerity of the emotions electrifying the film, and Garcia’s remarkable turn as Rene, he mostly succeeds.

NYFF Review: Bwakaw
By HUBERT VIGILLA February 20, 2020
From: https://www.flixist.com/nyff-review-bwakaw/

Broad comedy, soft character moments, and a dog.

It’s been a long time since I’ve seen a Filipino film. The last one must have been Crying Ladies with Sharon Cuneta in 2003, and before that it was a Dolphy movie or two when I was just a kid. There may have been a handful of other movies I can’t remember, but Bwakaw is probably just the fifth Filipino movie I’ve ever seen tops.

Bwakaw also happens to be the official Oscar selection from The Philippines this year. Not bad for an indie movie shot in roughly 10 days.

I can see why Bwakaw would be the country’s pick. There’s a polish to the direction that emphasizes the rhythm of different moods. The performances, whether they’re intimate or broad, are assured. And there’s a certain kind of appeal to a film about a lonely old man and his dog.

Eddie Garcia, a veteran actor and filmmaker in Philippine cinema, plays Rene, a cantankerous old man who spends his days cleaning up the local post office and being a grouch. He only has a handful of friends, and the closest one is his dog, Bwakaw. The animal actor is named Princess, and was apparently a last-minute replacement found on YouTube. It’s surprising that Princess wasn’t their first pick given how capable and well-trained she seems. She follows Garcia around like they’ve been together for years. There’s even a familiarity to the way Garcia treats her and holds her. When I was looking for stills for Bwakaw, I noticed a number of photos of Garcia and Princess together outside of shooting and they look like owner and pet.

Rene’s gay, but he only came to terms with his sexuality late in life. Rene had tried to pass as a straight man for years, and even had a long-term relationship with a woman, but the facade only made him bitter. Now that he’s well past his prime, he’s resigned himself to death alone. His house is a reflection of this. The whole place is in disrepair to a point where all the electricity gives out. Everything Rene owns is boxed up and ready to be given away when he finally keels over. Basically the only things that aren’t packed are a bed and his mother’s statue of Jesus which his neighbor thinks has healing powers. At one point early on in Bwakaw, Rene’s forced to keep a coffin at his house because the mortuary he bought it from is going out of business. He’s surrounded by memento mouris.

Rene is resentful of everything and everyone. He hates his co-workers, who have families who take care of them. He hates his two flaming hair dresser friends for being such comfortably over-the-top queens. There’s Zaldy (Soxie Topacio), whom Rene’s known since childhood, and there’s Zaldy’s transvestite assistant Tracy (Joey Paras). He hates Catholicism for making him think he was a sinner. Rene even hates himself for not being open and honest with everyone earlier in life. But at least there’s Bwakaw, though he kind of hates his dog at times too.

Garcia is the heart and soul of the movie, and it’s his performance that makes a lot of Bwakaw watchable. Most of the time it’s as if the only enjoyment he gets in life is putting other people down and letting them know how miserable they should be. But whenever Rene softens, it’s genuine. The smiles seem warmer given how cold he was before, and any tenderness in his voice feels like the real Rene peeking through all of the misery and guilt. These are the sorts of emotional extremes you’d expect from a person resigned to dying alone. The genuine happiness burns brief but bright. Writer/director Jun Robles Lana said the character was partially inspired by his mentor, the playwright Rene O. Villanueva (who was straight). It makes me wonder if Villanueva also had a cranky streak.

Bwakaw is full of broad comedy as well softer character moments, and the former which undercuts a lot of the potential sentimentality. A lot of that broadness comes from Zaldy and Tracy, who are about as flaming as you can get. Nothing says queen more than a middle-aged man with pink hair or a round guy in a halter top. It’s hard to even consider these stereotypes offensive since they’re at once so over-the-top and so sympathetic. Both Tracy and Zaldy care for Rene, even when he does put them down and push them away. They’re the closest Rene has to family whether he realizes it or not; their love is sincere and unconditional.

A lot of Bwakaw unfolds slowly, and I think that has to do with Rene’s emotional state. Lana captures the sense of waiting, which might sound bad, but it’s not. Rene’s waiting to die, so he’s in no hurry to get anything done, and the film finds visual interest in these moments. The opening of the film is Rene getting ready to do go through his daily routine. He’s deliberate about it, and it gives the audience a chance to get introduced to the pace and state of Rene’s life. For the first half of the movie, the only time Rene shows urgency is when he’s updating his will. There’s one memorable gag that gives a sense of this listlessness, and it involves a jitney and a man in an ox cart.

Bwakaw sort of unfolds the way you’d expect a movie about an old man and his dog would unfold. There are scenes of genuine tenderness and affection, and there are moments of meditative beauty. For the most part its revelations are quiet and epiphanies are intimate. Sometimes Rene will confess something that’s been bottled up in him for a long time, but Bwakaw leaves a lot of those feelings inside, which is more effective and more real. That’s what is must feel like when you’re coming to terms with death and trying to put your own house in order.

But Rene’s life becomes more complicated as the film moves along. The film’s pace picks up just a little, and because Garcia’s performance is so solid, I found myself carried along the way. Rene has all the items of his life boxed and ready, but you wonder if he’s actually ready to go. It’s that interesting thing that guilt and regret does to people after many years. On the one hand you wish it were all over already, but then again, sometimes you wish you could live your life right and had second chances.

There’s part of me that sensed where the film was going, not because Bwakaw telegraphs itself but because there’s a certain trajectory to movies about crotchety old men. Yet there’s an easy charm to the movie thanks to Garcia’s performance, and none of the lessons Rene learns are simple or neat. Whether it’s ruminative or slapsticky, Bwakaw endears, and it thankfully doesn’t try to be too sweet when it doesn’t need to. Lana’s film is assuredly itself without pretense. It never reaches too far or tries too hard. It knows what it is and is comfortable in its own skin, and that’s what’s likable about it.

Bwakaw: Movie Review from: https://www.reeladvice.net/2020/12/bwakaw-movie-review.html
December 23, 2020

""Bwakaw"" may seem to be a simple look into the life of an old, gay, grumpy man but at its core is a story that has a lot to offer beyond its initial offering and setup. It may not be obvious at first glance but this is a very rewarding experience overall.

Rene (Eddie Garcia) is a gay man who came out in his seventies. He is living alone in his mother's ancestral home. Already in his twilight years, he only has death to look forward to believing that love and companionship is an opportunity lost due to his age. Typically, he is preoccupied with taking care of a stray dog he has named Bwakaw. But when Bwakaw is diagnosed with cancer, Rene's daily routine goes into turmoil. Will this unexpected chaos finally help him to see the beauty of a life that he has already concluded as a lost cause?

At times, ""Bwakaw"" may feel like its plot and story is too simple but actually that is the reason why this film was an outstanding experience in our opinion. It doesn’t have the excess baggage that a typical mainstream film may consider a must to entertain audiences. And given its simplicity, the film came out much more authentic, real, and approachable. Our main character Rene may come out as annoying at first glance but the film was able to integrate his character’s evolution right into its narrative seamlessly. At the center of the film’s success was none other than the late Eddie Garcia. His portrayal as Rene was amazing to say the least and truly showed how great of an actor he was. “Bwakaw” was that rare experience wherein you really have a connection with its character - from his lows to his highs, from start to finish. Overall, while the film had faults, they came out as very minor when compared to its substantial and meaty character development.

Rating: 3 and a half reels

Why you should watch it:
- superb acting from the late Eddie Garcia
- the meaty and substantial character development 

Why you shouldn't watch it:
- the film isn't your typical mainstream film experience
- some may find the open ended start and ending too different

mov004,DieBeautiful_Poster.jpg,,,Die Beautiful,Jun R. Lana,2016-10-27,"A review by WYLDSTYLE (IMDb):

Actually I recommend everyone to watch this, not just Filipinos, and here's why. The Filipino film industry has been known to be...lackluster. Its list of LGBT movies is not that impressive, a lot of it is stereotypical and borderline offensive. However, Die Beautiful is a gem in Filipino cinema. This film is about the life of Trisha, from childhood until adulthood. It has a nonlinear story line and the scenes blend perfectly. Every shot is stunning, especially for a movie without a mainstream Hollywood kind of budget. This is a comedy, but far from the typical slapstick and low blow jokes we see these days. It's funny without being offensive or overly dramatic. The story does not disappoint either. It is relevant to the issues important in the world today and very heartwarming. Each one of us can relate at one point or another. A film of love—friendship, romantic, and familial. Definitely worth your 2 hours. One of the best entries in MMFF and generally all of Filipino cinema.

A PLSLETITRAIN (IMDb):

This is a good movie for a society which has become appreciative of LGBTs over time. The movie tells the story (and struggles) of Trisha Echevarria (Paolo Ballesteros), a transgender who was disowned by his rich father and survived on his own by joining beauty contests. He adopted a young girl and raised the family by the meager amounts he get from joining these pageants. Typical struggles of transgenders were given emphasis in the film: discrimination from the family, from the community, and from men. The title is Die Beautiful because it shows his life in throwback form: he starts dead here. He instructed his bestfriend that in case he dies, he should be shown beautiful in his coffin. He has to look like ""someone"" in all the 7 days of his wake.

The two-hour runtime may seem long to some, but I even think it was not enough. I wanted to see more. I even expected it to be light-hearted all through out because gay humor. But what I didn't expect is that it was very heartwarming and dramatic. Paolo Ballesteros deserved the awards that he got (both local and international) because he did really cement his role perfectly. He was a boy, he was a gay, he was a celebrity, became a transgender--all in this film! He was a son, a daughter, a sibling, a mother, a bestfriend, a pageant candidate, and a celebrity look-alike. Paolo Ballesteros has now become a household name because of this.

I have to give a shout-out to the other lead star in the film: Christian Bables. He was perfect in his role as the bestfriend of Trisha. Both leads were amazing in their portrayals.

Highly recommended.

mov005,Baka Bukas_Poster.jpg,,,Baka Bukas,Samantha Lee,2017-03-01,"A review by LETTERTHIEF (The Ugly Writers)
 
This film, directed by Samantha Lee, was a finalist in the narrative category of 2016 Cinema One Originals. It gained the attention of the people through the social media, because the story revolves around the most common and cliché thing, falling in love with your best friend. But there’s a catch, the lead roles are portrayed by both girls
.
I thought this film wouldn’t be given a nationwide screening, but it did, and being a part of the LGBT community myself, I decided to watch the film along with someone special to me, and see what the hype is all about.
 
“We were never in love, we were just each other’s in-between.”
 
This is one of the lines that would really strike you throughout the movie. It sends a message that sometimes the people we meet are really meant to leave in the end, because we were just each other’s lesson, a way of preparation for the real thing, love.
 
Both girls have been going through their own break-up phase when the film begins. The movie then takes us to the scene where Jess’ tags along with Alex, as she and with her other gay friends have a night out at a bar. This then leads to Alex’ accidental coming out to her best friend, and explaining her sexuality in her very own logic, and it involves using tapa and bagnet.
 
“One of the scariest things about coming out is finding out if the ones you love will stay after,”
 
Alex tells her friend Julo, after she came out to her best friend Jess.
 
This really struck me, because after being true to yourself and self-acceptance to your own sexuality, this comes second to the scariest thing. Coming out is easy, it’s the anticipation of the reactions and answers you’ll get that’s scary, it’s what kills you after spilling out the truth about yourself. Finding out if the ones you love will stay after is part of this anticipation, because in all honesty, we are all afraid of being left by the people we love, because we just can’t lose them.
 
Alex then faced a complicated relationship with her, as her feelings for Jess started resurfacing. This is now where Jess and Alex’s romantic feelings for each other started blossoming. But like in reality, a relationship like theirs faces a lot of hardships. One of this is to be told to hide who you are to save your career, and to be discriminated by the same members of the LGBTQ+ community who you thought will understand what you’re going through. This caused the two of them to separate. Alex chooses herself, and Jess chooses her career.
 
Just like what the title of the film says, “Baka Bukas”, the movie finished with an open ending, where the relationship of the two lead actresses can either be continued or not, and a thought that,
 
“Baka Bukas Pwede Na.”
 
The film really deserves a 5 star rating, because the plot tackles issues that I, myself faced and continues to face in this current generation and society. The movie features the struggle of coming out to your family, friends, and even in workplace, but mostly of being true to yourself. On the other side, Jasmine Curtis outdid herself and the expectations from herself. She was a great choice for the role, which sets her apart from her sister Anne.
 
She portrayed the role with such audacity that made her even more ideal for the movie. Her acting skills where very much highlighted not through the words she speaks but through the non-verbal actions. In most of the scenes in the film, not words were much needed but the proper body expression, and in those moments, Jasmine sparkles through, because her eyes and body movements expressed every emotion conveyed by the film.
 
And even though the film is LGBT themed, everyone will be and can relate to the story of the film.
 
How?
 
Jess’ cowardice showed us the realistic representation of how we, people love. It shows us that even though someone out there who is way better, who is more worth it that is already in front of us, we always tend to go back to the ones who wear stupid sparkly dresses, to the ones who make our heartache in the most painful way possible, to the ones who always want so much more. Whether you’re a girl or a boy, a lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, we have our very own Jess. The one we can’t say no to, the one we can’t unlike or unlove. Because the sad truth is, liking or loving them is not like a simple game of tug of war that if it’s hurting to hold on we can just let go. And I think that’s it, that’s who Jess really represents to us. Jess is our own person who gives us a lot of reasons to fucking leave and walk away, but we just can’t because no matter how much we stumble and fall, she or he will always be Jess.

A review by Graciela Mae:

With attempts at protecting its queer population being stuck in Congress for nearly two decades (a proposed Anti-Discrimination bill repeatedly dismissed), the Philippines’ attitude towards its LGBTQ+ population seems to circle around a culture of glass closets and deceitful tolerance. Thus, it is unsurprising that they receive little to no representation in mainstream media. Samantha Lee’s debut, Baka Bukas, centres around Alex; a 23-year-old Manila creative played by Jasmine Curtis-Smith. Alex is an out lesbian. The only person Alex has not come out to is her childhood best friend, Jess (Louise Delos Reyes) whom she is helplessly in love with. While not the most politically charged or heart-wrenching of films, Lee’s colourful encapsulation of the experiences of a millennial Filipina lesbian paves the way for the normalisation of truthful LGBTQ+ representation in the Philippines

Baka Bukas, which translates to Maybe Tomorrow, was inspired by the director’s own life – Lee also penning the film’s screenplay. One of the most obvious reasons for the title is Alex’s ‘mañana’ attitude in regards revealing her love and identity to Jess. While Curtis-Smith embodies Alex’s cool demeanour so effortlessly, Delos Reyes portrays the bubbly starlet, Jess, in a way that her more traditional beliefs (see Jess’ minor life crisis amidst her best friend coming out to her) comes off as comical rather than insensitive. With questions like “so it’s like best friends, but with making out?”, she portrays a number of Filipinos who were just never given a perspective outside the heteronormative lens. When Jess realises she has also fallen in love with her best friend, Lee does not erase the possibility of the character being bisexual; the character considering the label herself. The well-worn best friend trope ensues — to the instant recognition of both lesbian viewers and the rom-com obsessed Filipinos.

The film further attempts to capture the hearts of its target audience with its distinct aesthetic: soft pastel hues, neon lights, and an abundance of every Instagram feed must have you could think of (record players, denim jackets, they’re all there). Samantha Lee’s proclaimed love for directors such as Wes Anderson and Sofia Coppola is present throughout, but she pays homage in a way that doesn’t restrict her own cinematic voice.

Are there instances when the vivid colours and intricately crafted milieu are incapable of saving a rather monochromatic script? Sure. The film uncomfortably relies on expositional dialogue and often crosses the line between quirky and just plain awkward. When meeting Alex’s friends for the first time, Jess faces the unapologetic Julo and his blunt remarks about her messy Instagram feed. He scolds her to use ‘VSCO cam and Snapseed’ in the corner of a nightclub. Perhaps, Lee wanted to capture just that: the complex journey of growing into yourself during your twenties; full of hiccups and uncertainty, with everything and nothing happening all at once.

It is easy to dismiss Baka Bukas as another romantic-comedy-drama that uses a well-worn formula and quotable cheesy lines like ‘I’m the number one fan of who you are at 3 am’. But what makes the film stand out is how it captures the Manila creative scene in a way that feels familiar yet so untouched. After pitching a lesbian television series, Alex’s producers argue that the country is not ready … while simultaneously questioning whether coming out was ‘still a thing’.

Alex inevitably changes the love story into a heterosexual one. However, she is still not given the green light because her show starred a female protagonist that lacked the “coyness” and “demure” that the country is used to seeing. The film is incredibly self-aware. Lines such as “this is not some gay indie film” (another criticism Alex’s pitch faced) poke fun at how Baka Bukas’ own kissing scene was filmed so delicately in low-key lighting. This creative decision, intentional or not, allowed the film to be released nationwide under a PG rating.

Many have criticised the film for glossing over the harsher realities of most Filipino coming out experiences. In such a hyper-Catholic country, many LGBTQ+ stories that do make it onto the screen showcase intense hardship and renunciation. While this is tragically the reality faced by many, Lee’s exploration into the life of a lesbian who was lucky enough to be accepted by her family and friends is still worth sharing. A singular narrative, especially one rooted in such specificity, cannot somehow represent all stories and struggles. With well-known actors accepting non-stereotypical queer roles in a lesbian directed film, representation in the mainstream seems promising. Baka Bukas is not only a form of escapism but a source of hope — perfectly encompassed by the title’s alternative English translation, ‘Maybe it’s open’.

mov006,BillieAndEmma_Poster.jpeg,,,Billie and Emma,Samantha Lee,2018-10-22,"A review by The New Girl in School (IMDb):

Billie and Emma is a film from the Philippines written and directed by Samantha Lee. The film is partly in Tagalog, and partly in English.

Zar Donato plays Billie, a young woman from Manila, who has been sent to the smaller city of San Isidro, because her parents hope she'll lose her attraction to girls. Billie stands out immediately--she's the only student with short hair, she wears heavy boots, and she defends same-sex attraction. (The lesson plan on her first day is that same-sex attraction isn't a sin, but acting upon that attraction is a sin. Billie disagrees.)

Gabby Padilla portrays Emma, the perfect student in their Catholic school. She's bright, beautiful, and popular.

You can tell from the title that the plot will revolve around the relationship of the two girls, and it does. However, their are plenty of plot twists along the way.

The two leads do a good job, but I would single out two supporting actors for special praise: Cielo Aquino as Billie's aunt, who is a teacher at the school, and Beauty Gonzalez, as Emma's childlike mother.

We saw this movie at The Little Theatre, as part of Rochester's excellent ImageOut LGBT Film Festival. If you can't find it at a festival, it will work will on the small screen.

Billie and Emma was shown as a ""New York Sneak Preview."" Obviously, it hasn't been shown much. It only has 26 IMDb ratings, and I'm the first reviewer. The few people who have rated it produced an strong rating of 7.3, and I think that it's at least that good.

mov007,RainbowsSunset_Poster.jpeg,,,Rainbow's Sunset,Joel Lamangan,2018-12-25,"A review by KevBee:

In spite of sweeping nearly all the awards with a total of 11 prizes, including Best Picture and Best Director for Joel Lamangan, and grabbing the major acting honors - Best Actress for Gloria Romero, Best Supporting Actress for Aiko Melendez and Best Supporting Actor for Tony Mabesa, this was a hard film to find at the local movie complex. Thank goodness I managed to track it down. It's a joy in spite of the sad central theme of an elderly man dying of cancer. It is an affirmation of love and the power of the family. And it's nice to see a movie where all the leading characters are in their eighties.

If you manage to track this movie down - go and see it. It's different and it's real. Such a treat when so much fare on offer is fantasy.

A review by Rilmreviewph:

A film must connect to the viewers and the audience should be able to relate to the story and characters and those are the signs of a good film.

The issue of a Senior Citizen coming out and opening up to his family on his long standing love for a childhood male friend may be a new and interesting theme but Rainbow Sunset has gone beyond the issue of LGBT.

Rainbow Sunset is a Family film that connects to all of us, to every family regardless of your economic standing. It is about the double standards of our society; RAINBOW SUNSET IS a well written screenplay, very grounded, direct and natural lines and dialogues. Direction is very fine, no fancy shots, focusing on the objective and intention of the scene that resulted to a great storytelling. Most of the sequences were shot in a lock frame that gives the audience a clearer understanding of the message in almost all of the scenes.

Rainbow Sunset brings the audience to a natural flow of emotion. There are some light moments and there are many dramatic points. Rainbow Sunset makes the audience cry. But the drama and the tears you shed are not redundant, it escalates and builds up without the feeling of contracting chest or heart attack. it seeds down to he core of your heart towards the end.

Lead cast Eddie Garcia, Tony Mabesa, Gloria Romero with Tirso Cruz III, Aiko Melendez and Sunshine Dizon is indeed a casting coup!

Acting was superb! No overacting and I would say everyone has attained the ""being"" state of the characters.

After all the dramas, the most important take away is the importance of family. The family is basic core of our society and it is the fundamental support system for each of us. No matter how huge or heavy your burdens are, your FAMILY is there to support and help you.

PLEASE WATCH RAINBOW SUNSET! You will get your money's worth!

mov008,Born Beautiful_Poster.jpg,,,Born Beautiful,Perci M. Intalan,2019-01-23,"A review by Melissa Noelle Esguerra: 

As a sequel to Jun Robles Lana’s successful Die Beautiful (2016), Born Beautiful (2019) is an endearing  continuation to Lana’s film. Directed by one of the prequel’s producers, Perci Intalan, Born Beautiful follows the life of Barbs (Martin Del Rosario), best friend of the prequel’s protagonist, Trisha (Paolo Ballesteros) as she navigates a new reality without her best friend and undergoing several transformations as she attempts to find herself, whether as Bobby or as Barbs. 
 
For someone familiar with baklâ culture, I find it challenging now to discuss the phenomenon without the aid of my mother tongue. From a taxonomical perspective alone, it’s hard to explain. Considered a third gender, a baklâ was assigned biologically male at birth but has come to adopt feminine mannerisms and ways of dress. Some identify themselves as women, others do not and at the same time, some are only attracted to men while others don’t necessarily identify as homosexual. However, ask most and you’ll find that the word is generally synonymous with male homosexual which is an incomplete definition. For a culture that struggles to define itself to those outside of it, especially to those outside of the Philippines, a depiction that does it justice is essential. 

What Born Beautiful is able to do is provide a wonderfully nuanced insight in the culture and from an interior perspective where all its defining aspects are normalised, ranging from its own unique culture and approach to religion, family, sex, and relationships. In fact, throughout the film, heterosexuals are in the minority. From the use of their argot, Swardspeak, throughout the film to the familiar imagery and stereotypes (a baklâ running a funeral parlor is quite common apparently, says my mother), Intalan has provided a realistic, albeit somewhat occasionally rose-tinted, depiction of life as a baklâ. Even moments of discrimination are lightly glossed over, neglected, and rendered ineffective such as when pamphlets for a religious gay conversion camp are passed around at a Santacruzan (a religious-historical beauty pageant). Born Beautiful is not about a class of persons so often seen as marginalised in normal society, but in fact, about a class that is empowered and integrated. 

This equally reflects itself in Intalan’s direction. When Barbs finally begins to openly spend time with her new love interest, Michael Angelo, as the scenes come to mimic typical montages overlaid with a pop song as seen in Filipino romantic comedies. She watches him as he repairs his taxi, fools around with a wedding veil as they clear the contents of his car, shows up to his basketball games and appears as the “hot cheerleader” trope (with his fellow taxi drivers cheering behind him), and they toy with her cosmetics––it’s all very cute, quite frankly. But most of all, it’s not often one sees tropes such as these applied to a trans woman and a man’s relationship––and for the first time, I find myself smiling at the appearance of all the clichés of a romantic comedy. 

Similarly, this normalisation effect also reveals itself in Intalan’s treatment of the family unit and in relationships. At the Happy Endings Funeral Home, Barbs has Mama Flora, Kennie, and Princess––a one big, happy baklâ family. However, in looking to all of the heterosexual relationships in the film, one finds that they are all incomplete or born out of a compromise. For Michael Angelo, his wife appears to know that he has an attraction and has had relationships with baklâs yet they share a daughter and maintain a level of civility that even culminates in what felt like the world’s most awkward birthday party for their daughter with Barbs in attendance. There is a sense of loving acceptance there, a meeting at a halfway point that Michael Angelo himself eventually espouses when he accepts Barbs’ declaration that she can love more than on person and in fact, encourages others to do the same: “Love has no limits. The heart never becomes full. Love can never be contained. The more you give love, the more love you’ll have. You shouldn’t just love as deeply as you can, but as many as you can.” It’s a touching message and speaks volumes of what eventually takes place throughout the course of the film.

Del Rosario puts on a wonderful performance as both Barbs and Bobby. His oscillation between the identities of both characters is impressive, with Barbs’ larger than life, made for pageantry personality and Bobby’s subdued, gentle masculinity. The ability to do both with justice renders Barbs’ existential crisis to feel very honest and earnest. During her initial breakdown in the first half of the film, she’s had to do her walk as Reyna Elena at the Santacruzan on her own, she’s been abused by her first boyfriend, Gregory (also married), and her friend has just tragically died. “I’m so tired,” she cries, as she cuts off her hair, wailing. Despite her bratty, princess-like demeanour, we feel pity for her because it’s in that moment alone, there is a genuine rawness and desperation in the tears and in the symbolic act of cutting one’s hair. 

Without revealing too much, if there’s one aspect of the film and of Intalan’s direction that I find quite lacking, it’s during the abuse of power that takes place at the conversion group. If you’ve seen Die Beautiful, you’d find that it similarly mirrors what happened to Trisha in her youth. Though it serves as a moment of disillusion, I do take issue with how Barbs copes with it after it takes place. There is simply too little time too grieve, too little time to process the trauma, and in fact, it is presented as trauma, as she has a flashback in the second half of the film that gestures to its impact. In my mind, it would have been a crucial moment to show that sexual violence is not only a heterosexual phenomenon and when tied with the higher calling of institutional religion, it can further warp how victims see themselves, see their perpetrators, and how they come to cope with the trauma. 

Beyond that, I would also argue that the last 20 minutes of the film were unnecessary––the introduction of yet another plot twist was superfluous. The ensemble of characters that we had to start with were so multifaceted, complex, and vibrant. Had there been more time to delve into each of their stories further, Born Beautiful could have been a much more powerful film. For all its lightheartedness, I’m impressed at all the issues it’s managed to address but rather than being fully convinced of its effect, by it's end, it feels as though it’s tried to handle too much. 
 
An undeniably pretty film with a wonderful insight into baklâ culture and not to mention absolutely hilarious dialogue, Born Beautiful is a great watch at the face of it. But as a film that attempts to capture a snapshot of a life, it ultimately feels mildly underexposed.

A review by MR. BRIGHTSIDE:
 
‘Born Beautiful’ review: Humor is a weapon
 
Scrappy as it may seem, ‘Born Beautiful’ takes a subversive path to laughs and profundity, making it a light contrast to its predecessor ‘Die Beautiful.’
 
There’s a broad and raunchy type of humor in Born Beautiful that can be enjoyed on two levels. From a slapstick level, those coming in for an outrageous ‘laugh-out-loud’ time will likely be satisfied, provided they’re not easily offended by the unabashed (yet grounded) vulgarity that this film has. To a profound extent, the viewing experience can be even more rewarding once you realize that the film is way smarter than it seems. It deftly weaponizes humor to tackle a variety of socio-political issues, even touching on the most taboo ones.
 
Take this one scene for example. In the beginning of the film, Barbs (Martin del Rosario) and her friends rehearse for an upcoming Q&A competition. A character draws out a question and reads, “How many restrooms are there in the Philippines?” It’s a nonsensical question that nevertheless elicits a witty answer. But the recipient interprets it with a deeper meaning and responds with, “Three. One for men, one for women and one for persons with disability.” In that scene alone, the film casually brushes off the suggestion of having a separate CR for the ‘third sex’. It’s an early indication that this film will bear no usual themes of LGBTQ discrimination found in Die Beautiful. This sequel is way past that level now; Born Beautiful promises a brighter and more progressive take of the demographic that it represents.
 
In fact, the film basks in the celebration of a transgender’s life: “dare to live, dare to love, dare to be you,” as its tagline says. There are few speed bumps along the way, and I mean speed bumps because the film meanders with a couple of sub-conflicts before it gets down to its prime predicament—an element purposely not shown in the trailer. For the first act, mortuary cosmetologist Barbs Cordero struggles with identity crisis in the wake of her two friends’ deaths. What follows is an eye-opening and brutal ‘gay conversion therapy’ arc that may trigger people with strong religious beliefs. Plotwise, the subplot feels inorganic as we’ve already seen in the first film how self-assured Barbs is with her sexuality. It’s easy to get past that hurdle if this first act is viewed more as a plot device.
 
By the second act, the issue of polyamorous relationship is brought into light. Barbs finds herself torn between two lovers, each having their own ‘guilty pleasure’ appeals: an abusive tricycle driver Greg (Kiko Matos) and a committed taxi driver Michael Angelo (Akihiro Blanco). The film carefully treads away from the PSA territory by offering no self-righteous solution to the issue at hand. It just shows how polyamorous relationships can work in the LGBTQ community.
 
Originally commissioned as a twelve-episode cable TV series, this five-episode material truncated into a 90-minute full-length feature has its own share of flaws too. The screenplay plays out like a glorified sitcom burdened by pacing problems, occasional lame jokes and under-developed supporting characters. Perci Intalan and his writers steer the franchise to a more radical path, picking a blanket of issues along the way: racism, death penalty, unwanted pregnancy, the cost of beauty (that transcends up to death)—and even an impromptu sex education lesson (courtesy of Chai Fonacier’s delightful character) that otherwise gets heavily bleeped by MTRCB. By doing so, Born Beautiful tackles societal issues not as deeply as it can but rather as many as it can. It’s not the best approach that a film could have, but that should not discount the amount of nobility that this film has.
 
Apart from the makeup transformations, the highlight of this film has to be the much-anticipated cameo appearances of Barbs’ deceased best friend, Trisha (Paolo Ballesteros). It’s a pivotal role to the story but it can be disadvantageous as Ballesteros’ presence reminds us of Die Beautiful’s emotional depth, partly achieved through his excellent lead performance. To put it in BeauCon terms, as the new queen, Del Rosario has big heels to fill. He does a fine job in doing so.
 
Now comparing Del Rosario’s performance to the acclaimed original portrayer, Christian Bables, the latter might have an edge when it comes to dramatic scenes but visually, Del Rosario makes a more charismatic lead. By the time the film gets to its raunchy intimate scenes, my doubts has been erased as the actor, along with his co-stars Matos and Blanco, shows unwavering commitment to their roles. The rest of the supporting cast are also commendable, with Lou Veloso’s godmother-ish role garnering the audience’s biggest laughs.
 
Amid Born Beautiful’s scattered goals, they do converge towards a greater realization: the heart’s capacity for boundless love. One could have wished for a more affecting redemption upon its abrupt ending. The film closes on a totally different dynamic from where it started, ultimately making it feel like a pilot episode to a more promising aftermath. One can only hope that the full series will be released sooner than later this year.
 
3.5 out of 5 stars

This is quite a feat because last year, the top-grossing movie, The Day After Valentine's, only got P67.5 million. Also, the eight movies from last year's festival, including The Day After Valentine's, earned a total of P122 million by the end of the festival's run.

2. The movie also won a few trophies in this year's PPP Awards Night—Best Production Design and Audience Choice. Martin Del Rosario also picked up the Best Actor award for his role in The Panti Sisters.

3. The Panti Sisters director Jun Lana is also responsible for memorable LGBTQ+-themed films like Die Beautiful, Ang Dalawang Mrs. Reyes, and Bakit Lahat ng Gwapo may Boyfriend? Jun is also the youngest Palanca Hall of Famer having won 11 Palanca Awards for Literature.

What My Friend Thinks:
""The movie is a riot, full of naughty and clever punchlines. Lightly talks about LGBTQ+ acceptance in our society and makes you think beyond the norm. You'll walk out feeling like you had a lively and witty banter with friends."" —KZ Macam

What I Think:
I watched The Panti Sisters after a particularly busy and stressful week at work and had no regrets after, even if I ended going home at close to midnight on a weeknight. The movie made me laugh out loud for most of the film. It's naughty, irreverent, funny, and just a lot of fun to watch.

I wish it had more substance though. I watched Die Beautiful in 2016, Deadma Walking in 2017, and Ang Dalawang Mrs. Reyes in 2018 and consider those three films to be the standard when it comes to modern comedies tackling LGBTQ+.

For me, the measure of a good movie is if you walk out of the cinema thinking about it or figuring out your feelings about it. Unfortunately, there was no thinking or feeling that happened after I watched The Panti Sisters. Maybe it was the producers' intention to keep it light and feel-good. It's just a shame because it could have made a bigger impact on viewers if it had a stronger message and a more solid storyline.

I also wish that the characters of the Panti sisters were more developed. I felt like there were a lot of gaps and the characters ended up to be stereotyped. The most developed character for me was Sam's character, played by Christian Bables. He was definitely the star among the sisters for me. He and his ""baklang kanal"" character made the most impact.

Paolo Ballesteros' performance was pretty good, but I was expecting more. Maybe he just didn't have a lot to work with and that's probably why he came up a little short. Martin was great as Dane and I understand why he bagged the PPP Best Actor award. He was solid and consistent as the ""mahinhin"" K-Pop fan.

While the characters and story were lacking, this movie wins in the looks department. Paolo, Christian, and Martin were gorgeous when they turned into their drag queen personas. Paolo was regal and beautiful when she became Gabbi. Christian had a naturally feminine-looking face so it was easy for him to turn into the tough Tondo girl, Sam. Martin's Dane character, however, was the prettiest of them all.

The supporting cast also contributed to the laughs. John Arcilla as the strict homophobic father played his role well. Carmi Martin and Rosanna Roces had their moments, too, although I also wish their characters were more developed. Roxanne Barcelo, Joross Gamboa, and Via Antonio also had memorable scenes.

All in all, this is a funny, fun, and light movie which I'll probably watch again once it hits Cinema One or one of the streaming apps, just for a good laugh.

I'd Recommend It To:
Anyone who needs a good laugh. This is Vice Ganda-type of funny so if you need to let off some steam, this movie is for you.

Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino: ‘Open’ and ‘The Panti Sisters’ reviewed
By: Cody Cepeda / 05:23 PM September 27, 2019
From: https://entertainment.inquirer.net/346624/pista-ng-pelikulang-pilipino-open-and-the-panti-sisters-reviewed

While the honors have been bestowed upon the winners of the recently concluded Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino, and as Eduardo Roy Jr.’s “Lola Igna” earned Best Picture, it is still interesting to take note of how the rest of the offerings fared in terms of storytelling and in affecting their intended audiences.

We look at the crowd favorite “The Panti Sisters” which bagged the Audience Choice award and Best Actor for Martin del Rosario; and the steamy “Open” which has Arci Muñoz doing daring, sensual scenes. Though neither failed to bag the top prize from the festival, audience interest was high due to their provocative themes. Spoiler alert for those who have not yet seen both films.

‘The Panti Sisters’

Actors Paolo Ballesteros, Martin del Rosario and Christian Bables are larger than life as gay siblings Gabriel, Daniel and Samuel in Jun Lana and Perci Intalan’s comedy “The Panti Sisters”.

The story sees the three summoned by their rich father Don Emilio Panti (John Arcilla) to his mansion, years after Gabriel and Daniel were banished from home for being gay. Samuel, on the other hand, is Don Emilio’s illegitimate child and grew up in Tondo with his poor mother Vilma (Rosanna Roces), all the while longing for the presence of his father.

Don Emilio is dying of cancer and has promised to give an inheritance of P100 million to the first son able to give him a grandchild. What follows is a series of outrageous and absurd schemes from the siblings in their desperation to impregnate a woman and receive the fortune – from Daniel attempting to hit on women at a bar, to Gabriel and Samuel turning to their female friends Kat (Roxanne Barcelo) and Chiqui (Via Antonio) for connivance.

On the surface, the film amuses with its humor, the traded barbs and banter between the siblings is heightened by the undeniable chemistry of the actors. But it seems nothing is sadder than laughter, and flashbacks from the siblings’ childhood show that there are old wounds to tear open. In one scene, a young Gabriel admitting to his parents that he is gay is met with fury from Don Emilio. “Gawa ng demoyo ang bakla (The Demon created gay),” he says, before threatening to send Gabriel to the Philippine Military Academy to make a man out of him. In another, Don Emilio catches a young Daniel putting lipstick on his stuffed teddy bear Pepe. In fear of his father’s anger, Gabriel steps in and takes the blame and punishment, saying he was the one who took his mother Nora’s (Carmi Martin) makeup.

This was the kind of father Don Emilio was, a man so tightfisted with his love that he ruled his home imperiously and refused to be called “papa.” Don Emilio’s incapacity to accept and support his gay sons are experiences that no doubt run parallel to real life, far beyond the blinkers of film. Don Emilio’s coldness is only shattered when, in a sharp vicissitude in the film, one of his sons die after being shot by a group of thugs. In a defining moment that seems almost too late, a remorseful Don Emilio asks for forgiveness from his remaining children, only to be told by Gabriel that they have already forgiven him and that he needs to forgive himself. Weakened by the cancer that has just about engulfed him, Don Emilio finally asks Gabriel and Samuel if they could call him “papa” instead.

It would be impossible to divorce the LGBTQ+ experience from family; screenwriter Intalan himself reflected that family is foremost in many LGBTQ individuals. And behind its comedic devices, at times painfully conventional to a fault, “The Panti Sisters” succeeds in making this message simple and resonant to its audience: that we all want to be loved, to be wanted.

‘Open’

“Kulang na kulang ba ako?”

This was what an anguished Rome (Arci Muñoz) asked her boyfriend Ethan (JC Santos) in an intense scene near the end of the film that thus determined the fate of their 14-year-long relationship.

Rewinding back to the beginning of Andoy Ranay’s “Open”, it was made clear early on just what kind of dynamics Rome and Ethan have in their relationship. A scene of the two inside a bakeshop while on the way to have lunch with Ethan’s family showed how Rome easily gives in to appease her beloved, down to the quotidian act of choosing what kind of cake to buy. Rome wanted to get a strawberry cake for his family, but Ethan could not decide if he wanted matcha or salted caramel more. As the two go back and forth on what to buy, a seemingly exasperated Ethan tells Rome to choose instead as he walks out to go back to the car. Rome ends up buying the two cake flavors that Ethan wanted.

This would repeat itself later on in the film after Ethan discovers that their friends Archie (Vance Larena) and Monique (Ivana Alawi), who have just gotten engaged to each other, are in an open relationship. Citing the lack of excitement in their pretty much non-existent sex life, Ethan suggests to Rome the idea of going “open” to make sex with each other thrilling again. Rome adamantly rejects the idea, but when Ethan tells her that perhaps they should break up instead, only then does she acquiesce reluctantly.

The two agree that they can stop being open anytime and should only sleep with strangers; Ethan, however, violates this rule and uses the set-up as a license to sleep with Erika (Ina Raymundo), his older co-worker who he has been lusting after. As Rome struggles with her own guilt and shame in seeing other people, Ethan indulges in steamy trysts with Erika, all the while keeping it a secret from Rome.

It is not hard to predict just how Ethan and Rome’s open relationship would turn out, which was lopsided and not entirely built out of trust to begin with. But in the end, the tables appear to have been turned. An empty Ethan, in his confusion and futile search to fill a bottomless void, decides to return to Rome. But Rome has become more confident and successful separately from Ethan.

The climax of the film is reached during an intense confrontation between Rome and Ethan, after she discovers he has slept with Erika multiple times. In the scene, Rome tries her best to temper herself, but fails as she explodes at Ethan for his treachery. “Kulang na kulang ba ako?” she asks before breaking down in tears.

Here is a woman whose spirit has been flayed, stripped and undone, a woman who no longer has any emotional reserves left in her. The film is careful in its execution to show and not preach, and it does its best by doing away with unnecessary verbalization and by focusing on the shared silences between Rome and Ethan throughout. While predictable, the film veers away from peddling gospel truths; open relationships work for some, it may not for others, but what it should not be used as, perhaps, is a panacea for a crumbling relationship that is unsalvageable to begin with.

In the last scene, Rome and Ethan share a tearful goodbye for the last time in their apartment. As she sets out to leave, she pauses on her way down the stairs and looks back. It was in this moment that the audience in the theater does the talking. The viewers are conscious and they know better. “Go, bilis (quick)!” they urged her. “Umalis ka na (Leave now)!”

And Rome shares in this knowledge. She wipes her tears and walks away, stepping into the new beginning that is waiting before her.

A feel-good film with a heart: ‘Panti Sisters’ thrills Filipino viewers
By Francesca Militar | 24 September, 2019
From: https://pop.inquirer.net/79823/a-feel-good-film-with-a-heart-panti-sisters-thrills-filipino-viewers

Disclaimer: This article contains spoilers from the film.

When it comes to family, Allan Ramsay’s 1737 Collected Scots Proverbs says, “blood is thicker than water.” Oftentimes, this ideal rings true in many Filipino households–wherein mothers support their daughters, fathers defend their sons, and siblings look out for one another. However, in the case of siblings Gabbi (Paolo Ballesteros) and Daniel (Martin del Rosario) and their half-brother Samuel (Christian Bables), their father Don Emilio (John Arcilla) seems apathetic towards them–especially when it concerns their sexual identities and preferences.

Shunned by their father for being gay, the three go their separate ways and live their lives on their own terms. But when Don Emilio calls them back for the chance to earn their inheritance, the siblings reluctantly meet with their estranged father to discuss terms. Gabbi, Daniel, and Samuel earn the surprise of their lives as they must each father a child to earn their share of Don Emilio’s 300-million Peso inheritance.

Panti Sisters is a feel-good film that asks the question, how far would you go to earn your family’s love and acceptance?

If the synopsis wasn’t enough to convince you to watch the film during its extended run, here are three more reasons why you won’t regret watching Panti Sisters.

It’s a feel-good movie with a heart

Many times, films that deal with comedy often lose their sense of storytelling towards the end of the film–mainly because the production prioritized the punchlines over proper storytelling. In Panti Sisters, however, the tale of the three siblings is not only humorously told, but it also allows viewers to realize the heart of the movie–family.

Throughout the film, the “Panti sisters” slowly realize how blessed they are to have the support of one another. And with or without their father’s approval, the siblings realize that they are great just the way they are.

Ballesteros, del Rosario, and Bables make the perfect Panti trio

Though Ballesteros, del Rosario, and Bables each portrayed their roles effortlessly, it’s their combination of personalities that made the film truly enjoyable to watch.

With each scene made and each line delivered, these three actors seamlessly complemented each other, creating a unique dynamic that can be seen onscreen.

Its reviews and awards further prove why you should watch the film 

Last September 15, the “Gabi ng Parangal, Pagkilala, Pasasalamat (The PPP Awards Night and Thanksgiving Celebration)” awarded Panti Sisters with “Best Production Design” and the “Audience Choice Award”.

Moreover, Martin Del Rosario earned “Best Actor” for his role as Daniel in the film.

Panti Sisters was first screened at the Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino 3 celebration last September 13 to 19, 2019. But moviegoers can still watch the film during its extension from September 20 to 26, 2019. 

The Panti Sisters: Movie Review
December 13, 2020
From: https://www.reeladvice.net/2020/12/the-panti-sisters-movie-review.html

If we judge ""The Panti Sisters"" on comedy alone then the film brought enough laugh out loud moments to be an overall good experience. But we cannot discount the fact that the film had problems with its narrative and character developments as it was supremely limited by abrupt shifts in tones and story-telling.

Gabbi (Palo Ballesteros), Daniel (Martin del Rosario), and Samuel Panti (Christian Bables) are three siblings who are heirs to Don Emilio Panti's (John Arcilla) vast wealth. But the three are disappointments to their strict and masochistic father due to them turning out to be gays. Gabbi and Daniel were booted out of their homes earlier in their lives while Samuel is actually an illegitimate son who has never seen his father. The three are suddenly called back by Don Emilio to find out that he has cancer and has only around one year left to live. He plans to leave behind an amount of P300 million pesos upon his death but with one condition - his three gay sons must give him a grandchild before he dies. Given the huge amount of money at stake, the three Panti sisters agrees to the challenge but how will they actually accomplish the feat?

The first impression we have with ""The Panti Sisters"" was that it was as basic as it could get. It certainly provided enough to make it acceptable as a brainless time-waster and it's not the worst Filipino comedy film narratively-speaking but it definitely lacks any depth or even semblance to justify its existence. At the crux of this issue was that ""The Panti Sisters"" showed a particular lack of effort and polish on its part. The story was actually silly but quite normal for a comedy film. At least it was a great set-up to create crazy situations for our main characters to find themselves in. But the film was just disconnected and disjointed from scene to scene. It was as if each scene had their own bubbles and the important conversations and smaller scenes to tie them up were mostly missing. This had an impact on major and minor characters so much so that we didn't have an emotional investment with most of them. Characters will come and go and we found ourselves not impacted by their fates - even those that led to deaths. The strongest point for the film would be its script. While some of the jokes were heavy-handed, we found more jokes hitting the mark than missing the target completely. Overall, there are certainly better LGBT-themed comedies that are more substantial or emotionally impactful than ""The Panti Sisters"" - some even starring the same actors. It was not the worst Filipino comedy you can find out in the wild and if you temper your expectations, its major faults can be forgettable and forgivable.

mov010,Metamorphosis_Poster.jpg,,,Metamorphosis,J.E. Tiglao,2019-11-08,"A review from ReelAdvice:

By design, ""Metamorphosis"" will tug at your heartstrings. It is formulaic to a fault but it is also a film that sincerely made us shed a tear. While the journey of Adam was not perfect and had some very rough spots, the bigger picture was successful in showing the dilemma and eventual acceptance of our lead character to who he or she truly was. The first thing that caught us was the beautiful and artistic cinematography from Director J.E. Tiglao. Particular scenes in the film felt like they really had purpose not only to tickle your eyes but also your mind. On top of that, the film had great acting from its cast especially Gold Aceron as a kid struggling to find his identity and acceptance not only from his own but also from his close-minded family. Where ""Metamorphosis"" struggles most was in its narrative development. Topics and conflicts are put out shotgun-style but never fully developed or resolved. Even serious topics such as a scene of harassment was just brushed off as if nothing happened. Some elements also felt forced and totally unnecessary such as the occupation of Adam's closest friend Angel. To end our review, while not perfect, ""Metamorphosis"" was a deep and substantial experience. It was emotionally-heavy and psychologically-moving. It seems like a waste though as with better and cleaner execution narratively, it could have morphed into a landmark film.

A review by Engelbert Rafferty:

 While the film can be incriminated for being formulaic, melodramatic and on-the-nose in depicting Adam’s story of sexual awakening, the film lays bare its heart by showing Adam’s physiological and psychological development as the discovery of his gender pits him to making a decision. As the universe somehow dictates everything that he should do, from undergoing surgery to escaping a newly-discovered part of his being, he walks through life with a mask of indifference, uncertain of what both the present and the future will bring him. Gold Azeron carries the mask with nary a sliver of hesitation. Azeron conveys his character as though he himself has lived through the struggles of an intersex; never did he show any sort of hesitation in carrying the role through the weight of his shoulders and while this is only his second film, after 2016’s Lando at Bugoy by Vic Acedillo, he has proven himself to be a stalwart actor.

More than a story about sexual awakening, the film provided a clear-cut look into the difference between the mindsets of the people in the 90’s versus the mindset of the people in the 21st century. While nowadays people have become more understanding and the horizons of knowledge regarding gender and identity have been broadened significantly, at the time set in the film people were locked on limited ideals that for the most part has hindered them from welcoming the idea of equality. One example of this is how circumcision at the time is a requirement for all adolescent boys so that they can be considered to be an adult; otherwise, one is subject to a flurry of shaming. Another example is quite evidently the condition surrounding Adam’s physical state. Despite having two genitalia, Adam has been put into trial by forcing him to accept only a single sex since having two genders go beyond the doctrine of the bible, considered by many people especially in far-flung areas as the prevailing ideals of the masses. With the two objects of desire personified in the form of Angel and his endocrinologist Dr. Tolentino (Ivan Padilla) who has served more as an educator regarding the truth among the intersex, Adam has been forced to be stuck in an existential crisis, uncertain of where his true feelings belong to and uncertain of what side of the spectrum he should lean on: the feminine side or the masculine side. Adam at first is not able to get the opportunity to say what he truly feels and becomes what he truly wants to be; his life is dictated by his pastor of a father who claims to know better than him. Like many intersex people who had to go through hell or high water to share their voices, Adam becomes a victim of his self, the society he lives in and his peers. In Adam, we see ourselves rising through the ashes, flying like the beautiful butterfly trapped in a glass jar waiting to be set free.

Butterflies have an average life span of one month and in the film, we see Adam to be burying one among the many butterflies that he had taken care of. This signifies the constant change and development of an individual over time. The cycle of a butterfly’s metamorphosis is akin to human development, wherein we start off as hollow vessels then eventually we grow into the type of person that we are now. A part of us dies in the process too: beliefs, aspirations, outlooks in life etc. With death comes the birth of another entity, another part of our life that will undergo the same cycle as that of a butterfly. We liken ourselves to butterflies because like the unique patterns that cover the façade of their physical existence, we too build our inner and outer beauties based on the experiences and circumstances that shape and mold us into what we eventually turn out to be.

The film’s true suffering lies in the lack of flair in the screenplay. While the film was able to make its powerful message come across, Tiglao and his co-writer Boo Dabu could have made some of the key moments in the film more memorable, but had instead relied on cringe-filled dialogue that resulted to these powerful moments turning into an exercise in schmaltz and ridicule. One scene in the film shows Adam talking to Dr. Tolentino, wherein they were just talking about how being handsome can serve its purposes in a society filled with standards on beauty and gender. Another scene shows Adam being asked by his parents what type of sauce he prefers to go along with the food that they were eating, then comes back with having a combination of soy sauce and vinegar (a common pairing like fish and chips or bread and butter in the Philippines). Had the scenes that are vital in the film could have been delivered with more finesse, it is possible to have seen better character development with not just Adam but also the other characters involved in his life.

Metamorphosis is like a post-impressionist painting; the film brims with light and color and casts its magic along its audience to deliver its message of love and acceptance to everyone, regardless of who you are and what you are. Metamorphosis is Tiglao’s love letter to the unaccepted, a wholesome and inspiring correspondence to the community who, although taking pride in allowing love to win against all odds, has voices still that are lost and missing in this damned world. The film speaks well of humanity and all its notable imperfections. As we come to acknowledge these imperfections in our lives, we become like Adam in the end: naked, vulnerable, free, but never afraid.

ser001,MyHusbandsLover_Poster.jpeg,,,My Husband's Lover,Dominic Zapata,2013-06-10,"REVIEWS ON MY HUSBAND'S LOVER

My Husband's Lover is filled with symbolism
By James Tekiko

My Husband’s Lover is a breath of fresh air in the often stale and boorish telenovelas of the last two decades. Never has Philippine television engaged viewers in a unique love triangle—a married man caught between his loving wife and his openly gay lover. Although we may be modern users of the Internet and cell phones—by the way, devices integral to MHL—our level of tolerance for stories on the boob tube is always limited to heterosexual relationships and issues. Gays may be part of a TV drama series but they are never the lead characters. They are always the comic relief or the best friend in a supporting role.

In My Husband’s Lover, the gay characters and the wife are the protagonists. Carla Abellana essays her biggest role ever on TV as the clueless wife, Lally Agatep-Soriano. Tom Rodriguez plays Vincent Soriano, Lally’s husband who is a closet gay still pining for his high school lover Eric Del Mundo (Dennis Trillo).

Director Dominic Zapata dares to take on issues that conservatives would rather sweep under the rug such as homosexuality, infidelity and extended family dynamics. Suzette Doctolero’s story/script faces the issues head-on without resorting to histrionics and uber melodramatic monologues.

The story unfolds initially from Lally’s point of view. But the conflict revolves around Vincent’s denial of his true gender identity and its repercussions once he gives in to his secret desires.

ENSEMBLE ACTING. Dennis Trillo is very effective as the openly-gay architect still in love with his best friend. His body language, its nuances and gestures, mark him not only as an actor but as a true artist. Handsome, bedimpled Tom Rodriguez is a revelation—he can act after all! You can feel Vincent’s pain, confusion and inner struggles all at the same time, without his uttering a single word.

Through the lead actors’ rapport, the chemistry between Vincent and Eric is palpable. When they gaze at each other and hold hands you can feel the love emanating from them. In spite of Vincent being a family man, we can’t help rooting for the lovers whose emotions are genuine and pure. Romantic strings tug at the heart each time they meet, accidentally hold hands, gaze into each other’s eyes.

Their intimate scenes are performed with utmost care and decency. You can feel their yearning for each other without bed scenes, indecent exposure or torrid kissing scenes. Dennis and Tom, aside from being good actors, are pleasant to the eyes as well, making their characters even more appealing.

On the other hand, you also feel for the wife. She is a victim here. Her marriage is a sham; she’s clueless about her husband being gay. Carla Abellana is brilliant in her role. As the naïve wife and obedient daughter-in-law, she seamlessly fits into the role. Her acting is subdued throughout the series, even when she catches her husband with his gay lover. Her eyes speak volumes of her pent-up frustration and resentment.

To our surprise, Kuh Ledesma (Elaine Soriano) and Roi Vinzon (Armando Soriano) have chemistry, too. Elaine may be your typical “halimaw na biyenan” but she still empathizes with Lally. She does not tolerate Vincent coming home late and forgetting his marital duties. Her character is real, not one-dimensional.

As Vincent’s homophobic dad, Roi plays his role to the hilt, yet Armando’s bantering with his wife and other family members lightens the story. Armando is hateful and charming at the same time.

Chanda Romero as the visual artist Sinag Del Mundo is the compassionate yet down-to-earth mother of Eric. Sinag represents modern parental values laced with social norms and mores. In Freud’s psychosexual theory of development, she is the super ego, the conscience. She accepts her son unconditionally but she intervenes and never fails to mince words when telling him off for his affair with a married closet gay.

Eric’s BFF Danny (Kevin Santos) and Vince’s friend/former lover David (Victor Basa), though gay themselves, do not tolerate the Eric-Vince shenanigans. The Soriano kids Diego (Antone Limgenco) and Hannah (Elijah Alejo), always cute and adorable, complete the picture of a “happy” family, making you want to shield them from pain.

PRODUCTION. Editing is fast-paced, gritty and innovative in this TV series. No dull moment. Not a second wasted. Flashbacks and present action are frequently interspersed, making the story more dynamic and reinforcing character development.

Visually, My Husband’s Lover is appealing to the eyes. Camera angles lure the viewers into the deepest emotions of the characters without overpowering them. Transition shots blend one scene with the next smoothly. The Soriano mansion may be everyone’s dream, but for Lally, particularly in the first few weeks of married life, it is a gilded cage.

Initially, the downside of the show was the music. Kuh Ledesma’s “One More Try” drowned out every dramatic scene, being played during opening and closing credits and every scene in between, much to the chagrin of viewers like me. This is saying a lot because I’m an avid Kuh Ledesma fan.

But netizens were able to send their message across; during the last two weeks of the show the musical scoring was more subtle. It even now has Jonalyn Viray’s “Help Me Get Over” which alternates with Kuh’s song and makes the scenes more poignant. Music is now used effectively, as in the breakup scene of Eric and Vincent, heightening emotions so that you almost feel your own heart break.

Symbols and metaphors are significant in My Husband’s Lover. For instance, the rain pouring heavily during Vincent and Lally’s wedding seems a pouring of blessings; metaphorically, it forecasts the heartaches and trials that would befall the marriage.

Lally’s suspicion that her husband has a mistress ends with a key that opens a Pandora’s box of lies and deceptions far worse than she ever thought. Her shoe that falls as she lies unconscious in shock evokes the Cinderella fairy tale, but for her there’s no happy ending in store. As for the lovers, the wine glass that Eric drops when Vincent breaks up with him, lacerating his feet as it shatters, symbolizes their world gone to pieces.

Kudos to team MHL and GMA-7 for coming up with a series that encourages viewers to question their belief system and core values. To say that I love this show is an understatement. It is one of the best TV shows in 2013.

‘My Husband’s Lover’: Engaging love story
By Mike De Guzman

MANILA Philippines – A colleague of mine gushed in her admiration for “My Husband’s Lover” at a recent office meeting. She went on to assert that it was a “groundbreaking” teleserye.

As the only (known) gay man in the room, I felt I betrayed the tribe when I admitted that I hadn’t seen the show. Of course, I had my doubts, because I thought GMA’s melodramas were either badly written or terribly acted or sometimes both.

So I kept off this program and let the flurry of social media attention blow past. But when the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines came into the picture, weighing in on this serye, watching “My Husband’s Lover” became too tempting to resist.

“My Husband’s Lover” would have been a self-explanatory title except that the “Lover” in this case is also a man, as you all know by now. The story is told from the perspective of the wife, Lally, played by Carla Abellana.

The first scene I saw involved a chance encounter (14:30 to 14:40 of this video) between husband Vincent (Tom Rodriguez) and old flame Eric (Dennis Trillo). They stood facing each other, as in a Mexican stand-off, but without the guns and the skull-drilling sound of an electric guitar.

Strains of an old Kuh Ledesma song blared for the entire duration of this scene (a recurring theme whenever I’d catch the show). Eric’s eyes would go all malagkit upon seeing Vincent who, in turn, looked like he was having a gastric reflux attack. The scene ended awkwardly, which I didn’t mind. Such endings were plausible and believable.

The next time I caught its telecast, Eric, in a flashback to a previous episode, is shown beaten up by a guy, after what might have been a proposition that prompted this reaction instead. He ends up in the hospital, bruised and one eye closed.

His mother (the wonderful Chanda Romero) implores him to report the incident to the police, but Eric refuses, for fear of the cops no less once they’re apprised of the circumstances of his mugging. Chanda expounds on his sexuality being irrelevant and so on.

Here, the show almost crosses over to being didactic, especially in her scene with the policemen who glance knowingly at each other when Chanda bares the telling detail that Eric met his attacker at a bar.

But Chanda is effective in her role as Jiminy Cricket to Eric’s Pinocchio, admonishing the lovers against carrying on their affair. Her expression (at 14:11 of this video) on finding Eric alone with Vincent is priceless.

The lovers are certainly easy on the eyes. They have many tender and intimate scenes — as much as Philippine television would allow anyway — but I like them better when they’re just on the verge of touching each other.

Dennis Trillo, in particular, is able to convey an intense yearning or pathos when he looks at Tom Rodriguez, who, unfortunately, handsome that he is, could still use a lot of acting workshops. (He was quite charming in “Be Careful with my Heart” but that was a much less demanding role.)

Carla Abellana seems to be going through the motions as the wife, but this is perhaps because her character is still underwritten. Could the writing be too focused on the lovers? Maybe, in the coming days, the show will give her more “meat to chew,” so to speak, especially when she finds out about the affair.

There is an obvious restraint or pagtitimpi in the way the characters react to the proceedings — no hysterics, no sampalan and barbed words so far. It’s quite refreshing.

Gay characters are certainly not new in Philippine drama, even in fantasy seryes. But more often than not — with notable exceptions being Lino Brocka’s “Ang Tatay Kong Nanay” and Joel Lamangan’s “Pusong Mamon” — they are portrayed playing second fiddle to the principal characters or providing comic relief as the plot turns serious.

And apart from so rare performances by the likes of Eddie Garcia and Tony Mabesa, we seldom see in our melodramas gay men who are completely straight-looking. In that sense, “My Husband’s Lover” is indeed groundbreaking.

This is probably what raises the hackles of our “moral guardians.” It’s very easy to dismiss homosexuality where it can be easily recognized: among drag queens and comedy bar hosts. Being in their presence does not diminish one’s “straightness” and may even show how “broad-minded” one can be. But any behavior outside those stereotypes is unsettling and unacceptable.

I am still surprised that not a few people even today still think I should wear a dress or use cosmetics because I’m gay.

I can imagine parents watching this show aired 5 nights a week right at their homes being hit by the realization that, hey, this can happen to me or anyone among my family; and precocious, resourceful gay kids searching this serye on YouTube, watching in solitude, searching for parallels to their young feelings and emerging desires.

The people behind “My Husband’s Lover” seemed to have really thought through this show (and its impact/implications). So far it has avoided every cultural sensitivity mishap, managed to balance imparting its “message of equality” with telling a fairly engaging story, and, most important, showed that love exists in its myriad forms.

I just hope this story doesn’t take an ugly tragic turn, as commonly happens to gay characters in drama, which imparts instead the subliminal conclusion that being gay is wrong and will lead to tragedy. – Rappler.com

ser002,TheRichMansDaughter_Poster.jpg,,,The Rich Man's Daughter,Dominic Zapata,2015-05-11,"A review by Cyril Dason:

Due to the impact of this movie, this will not be one of those typical reviews I do on a TV series/drama. This will be slightly a bit more. Before I go on, let me just give you some
insights of a Philippine telenovella, as they used call it, titled 'The Rich Man's Daughter'. The
drama is about a rich girl named Jade, whom was born into a rich family which is conservative
and deep into Chinese tradition. Somehow, despite having a boyfriend (David), she fell in
love with another girl known as Althea, and BOOM! That's where everything starts. The
moment they fall in love was captured quite well in the series. The chemistry between Althea and Jade was obvious.

If you have not noticed, this is a drama about lesbians, or the Lesbians, Bisexual, Gays and
Transgender (LBGT) community. To be really honest, I decided to watch this novella because of the front poster of the series, which featured Jade Tanchingco (played by Rhian Ramos). I mean look at her!

But, there was something in the story line, and Icontinued watching despite the fact that the
first episode was sort of a monologue, which I usually do not enjoy.
Anyway, a long story short - This novella has made me understand the struggles and hardships of LGBT community better. I admit, I used to wonder why would some girl want to be with another instead of with a man, but this novella has somehow explained that to me, though I must admit that I am still not for the idea of two people of the same sex ending up together. Nonetheless, the novella has allowed me to think beyond the fact that LGBT is just about sexual preferences, as I now realize that the community is only hoping to have their choices in life respected. I mean, it is hard enough for them to realize and know they are going against the teachings of God, why should we, the straights, make their lives even more miserable by judging them? While some may say ""it is just a story a.k.a novella', but you have to admit that such stories come from true stories, and if you look at our Malaysian society nowadays, such thing, as in how bad we treat LGBT is indeed happening. It is sad when we act like God and pass judgement over others we perceive as ‘wrong’.

Well, I know some of you will be quick to judge my opinion on LGBT based on this particular post (because that is how us humans are), but I would like to stress that while I still firmly
believe that it is not right to be a lesbian, bisexual, gay, or transgender due to my religious
beliefs, I also believe that we have no right to judge, bully and put them down. These words from an article I found in the ""Christian Apologetics & Research Ministry' sums up the best on how I feel about LGBTs: ""Just because someone is a homosexual, does not mean that we persecute them, call them names, sue them for not agreeing with us or offending us, or get laws passed to silence them. We are to love them. Homosexuality is a sin, and like any other sin, it needs to be laid at the cross and forsaken. Yes, I know, easier said than done. That is true with all sins."" Just to be clear, I have never treated any LGBT I know differently, and I most certainly do not mind being friends with them. I only have a slight, or rather big problem if the men start
touching me because that's when everything gets odd for me as a person who is straight.
Else, I don’t have a problem with them.

If you find yourself constantly poking fun over LGBT's, you should watch 'The Rich Man's
Daughter'. It is mind opening. Trust me.

ser003,Hanging Out.jpg,,,Hanging Out,Petersen Vargas,2016-12-19,"A review by SCIENCEGAL:

Even though Hanging Out about gay men in Manila, there are things that made it relatable to people worldwide, e.g. Grindr hookup, knocking on the wrong door, or even trying to snap a great picture of food (going to the extreme of standing on a chair to do so).

The acting, the plot, or the dialogue have huge rooms for improvement. Namely, there are awkward shots, prolonged silence, strange lighting and weird camera movements. Sometime, it can distract you from what the characters are saying (especially when you need to read subtitle) but it is not a catastrophe.
One thing that makes this web series heartwarming is that Adrian and his group of close-knitted friends. They talk about silly stuff, tease each other, gossip, and just hang out. Seeing them banter with each other like old friends do, it made me feel both included in the group and yet intruding on their moment. Another reason why Hanging Out might be worth watching is the attractiveness of the cast. Adrian is kind of attractive with that chic look and purposely messy hair. And David has his cute boyish charm.
As for gay positivity, this web series showed gay men post-coming out, where they are comfortable about their sexuality. We get to learn about them as a character instead having their struggle with their sexuality define them. They are gay, and they are their own person.
I wish the series was better but still, as is, Hanging Out is a big step toward telling the stories of Filipino gays, queers, bisexuals, trans and lesbians. Watch it, or not watch it, it is up to you.

ser004,Gameboys.jpg,,,Gameboys Season 1 (Web Series),Ivan Andrew Payawal,2020-10-23,"Filipino BL: How ‘Gameboys’ gets it right
By RYAN MACASERO | AUG 3, 2020 4:05 PM PHT
From: https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/series/gameboys-filipino-bl-series/

The lesson is that all forms of love are valid – and we should keep telling our stories of love until society catches up to this truth.

First off, I’m not into romance films or series in general, so I never thought I’d get into the Boys’ Love (BL) genre. But here I am. Second, there are enough think pieces on why BL series popped off during this lockdown, so I’ll spare you from any attempt to intellectualize that. But the point is I, too, fell into the BL rabbit hole, like I never thought I would.

After spending my time off work on a Thai BL binge, I decided to check out the new ones that were coming out of our very own country.

I heard of Gameboys when it first came out but was only compelled to check it out when a friend recommended it to me.

As a millennial, I didn’t think I could relate to a Gen Z love story (wow, may ganoon?). I am also not a gamer.

Anyway, I realized, if I could watch something as light as 2gether: The Series, I should keep the ageism in check, and give it a chance. (READ: SarawaTine helped keep myself ‘2gether’ during the lockdown)

Without giving too much away, Gameboys basically revolves around popular streamer Cairo Lazaro (Elijah Canlas) and the flirtatious Gavreel Alarcon ( Kokoy de Santos). The story follows how their purely online friendship developed into something deeper, with the help of Gavreel’s best friend, the energetic and supportive Pearl Gatdula (Adrianna So).

While the first 3 episodes got me feeling like I might be too old for this show, by episode 4, I couldn’t stop watching.

Here are 5 reasons why I became a fan of this show:

It’s unproblematic
While I enjoyed the Thai BL shows recommended to me by friends, the enjoyment always came with a caveat. If the show was not entirely problematic, there was always an element of it that was.

In one show, for example, a male character commented on a female character’s revealing clothes. That’s definitely a no-no.

In another, the flamboyantly gay character was made the comic relief and was treated like a pest, while the conventionally attractive ones would get to live out their happily ever after.

In Gameboys, while Gavreel may be flirtatious and a bit pushy at times with the emotionally-guarded Cai, in the first episode, he asked for Cai’s consent before courting him. 

Consent is always important.

It’s relevant to the times
Aside from the themes of coming to terms with one’s sexuality and the struggle for acceptance in Filipino families – which have been tackled time and again in Filipino cinema – Gameboys also addresses the barriers in developing friendships and relationships in the time of coronavirus, when physical contact is not possible.

Can people fall in love without meeting first? How do people fall in love in the age of Zoom? What are families affected by COVID-19 going through right now?

The show not only gives the audience perspective into queer life under quarantine, but it also provides a window into many Filipino lives under lockdown.

The female character is powerful
In many BL stories, female characterization is often problematic. Many times, she is jealous and out to destroy the relationship of the boy couple.

That’s not the case here. Pearl is the foundation, the glue, that holds Gav and Cai together. She is unfiltered and calls out the BS when necessary, but is there to lift her friends’ spirits when they are down.

She’s the best friend every queer person wants or is blessed to already have.

In short, a queen.

The performances are brilliant
I don’t watch BL for the acting. I watch it to escape, for the flirtation, for the kilig. But this cast surprised me. They delivered all of that and more. I felt like I was watching theatre on screen.

Because there isn’t much fancy camerawork that can be done while the cast shoots under quarantine in their homes, all eyes are on their performance.

The subtlety and thoughtfulness of Elijah Canlas’ performance stood out for me. His performance as a young adult struggling to come to terms with his identity, along with uncertainty that comes with it, was both truthful and compelling.

The story is truthful
Before I tune in to any new BL series, I always remind myself that what I’m watching is fantasy and unrealistic. Basically, I tell myself to be quiet and just be distracted and entertained.

Aside from needing an escape from the darkness of the real world and a distraction from my loneliness, I wanted to feel emotions different from the ones I get from reading and writing bad news every day.

And if heterosexuals always get their cheesy, kilig, unrealistic fairytale stories with happy endings, then it’s about time we have ours, too.

But this way of telling a BL story was much different. It was too real.

Somewhere, a gamer boy struggles with his sexuality, and is probably spending time making friends online to help him figure himself out.

There is a flirtatious Gav who wears his heart on his sleeve and is not ashamed to show the world his feelings and is willing to do anything to get the one he wants.

There is a woman out there with the heart and compassion of Pearl.

These are normal people that exist out there in the world. They are our classmates, our coworkers, and friends.

Their struggles are our struggles.

Over the course of this show, I found myself living vicariously through Cai. I saw myself in him, even. Cai is who I could have been if I had the same courage to confront my bisexuality when I was that age. (READ: [OPINION] The B in LGBT: The long journey to coming out)

The years I spent ashamed and hiding a part of my identity, I will never get back. But by supporting these kinds of stories that portray boy love as any other kind of love, maybe, just maybe, people will start to get it.

That love is love. Period.
While this is a difficult time for everyone, including those in the entertainment industry, it’s also an exciting time for storytellers. And, in the future, I hope we go even further by telling stories of non-binary love, of girl love, of polyamorous love.

The lesson is that all forms of love are valid – and we should keep telling our stories of love until society catches up to this truth.

‘Gameboys’: How the Lockdown Unleashed a Modern Love Story
By: E. Avena | July 4, 2020
From: https://www.rankthemag.ph/review-gameboys-lockdown-unleashed-modern-love-story/

Gameboys’ is proof that creativity can’t be restrained in quarantine. Beyond adapting a global phenomenon to the Philippine setting, the BL series is an innovative and relevant narrative for the times.

The new YouTube series Gameboys started modestly enough: a 10-minute pilot episode where two boys meet online. Gavreel (Kokoy de Santos) has just beaten Cairo (Elijah Canlas) in an online game–marking a first in what appears to be a very popular social media life of the latter. They agree to do a rematch, but only when Cairo consents to Gavreels’ wooing–pass or play. In the next episodes, a love story blooms, and a breakthrough boys’ love (BL) series unravels.

The concept is intriguing. Gameboys is set in the present, with the COVID-19 crisis as backdrop. Restricted by the lockdown, the characters interact through video calls and instant messages, and we learn more about them through social media posts and stories. The show is instantly relatable because the characters navigate the same unfamiliar circumstances as their viewers and use the same technologies that people in the real world are left to use to connect and communicate with friends and loved ones.

Gameboys is a case study for limitation giving birth to creativity. It is the brainchild of the production outfit The Idea First Company, whose leaders Jun Robles Lana (Barber’s Tales, Anino sa Likod ng Buwan) and Perci Intalan (Dementia, Unforgettable), have said they wanted to continue telling stories in spite of, perhaps, even because of, the global pandemic.

To deliver Gameboys, the filmmakers have to creatively work around the same restrictions confronting the show’s characters. Director Ivan Andrew Payawal (The Comeback, I America) remotely gives the orders from home. Without a camera crew, set designers, nor make-up artists, the series depends heavily on Ash Malanum’s script, which smartly pulls from pop culture and displays intimate understanding of how the young generation is using technologies to connect and communicate. But its very core, Gameboys also leans on its young character actors, who are forced to navigate an unfamiliar work environment–to say the least.

And this is where the show made one of its smartest choices: casting. Both de Santos (F#*@BOIS, Tumbang Preso, I AM U) and Elijah Canlas (Kalel, 15, Sundalong Kanin, Sakaling Di Makarating) have been acting on film and TV shows for years.

While both actors had a breakthrough last year in their own festival outings, (F#*@BOIS for de Santos; Kalel, 15 for Canlas), they have been building their acting careers for a while. This experience strongly manifested with believable, nuanced performances in Gameboys, especially in its latest episodes, where the show starts to build gravitas.

Considering they act at home in their own clothes while looking straight into a phone camera that a family member operates, de Santos and Canlas are very effective in conveying emotions with just facial expressions–especially their eyes. Their love-struck characters in Gameboys are a departure from grittier roles both have played before. And as the series continue to rake in the numbers, all eyes are on both of the young actors as the series will likely catapult its actors to stardom.

With the release of each episode, Gameboys continues to grow its massive following, not just in the Philippines, but around the world. Every new episode amasses more views in the first 24 hours than its predecessor. The show is published with English subtitles, but fans from around the globe interestingly contribute subtitles, allowing the show to reach even more audiences.  

Part of Gameboys’ popularity, of course, is because it’s an adaption of the Boys’ Love (BL) genre, which traces its roots in Japan. This has recently seen an explosion, especially in Asia, where immensely popular BL shows from countries like Thailand and South Korea have been sweeping the region. Gameboys is credited for being one of the first, certainly the first truly popular, BL shows from the Philippines.

It has to be said, though, that the BL genre is not without controversy. Original BL content were made with a heterosexual female audience as the primary target, making the lens with which gay lives are captured somewhat problematic. There’s also the question of what straight actors playing gay characters means for representation, and whether these actors are using the platform that BL gives them to raise LGBT voices.

However, if there’s one production outfit that can effectively adapt the BL genre to the Philippine setting, it’s The IdeaFirst Company, the very studio that gave us films like Die Beautiful and Barber’s Tales, which tackled LGBT themes with finesse and wit.

Gameboys adds to their canon of stories that are in touch with the times. In fact, one of the loudest messages in Gameboys is what’s not being explicitly said: that love between two boys is like any other. In Gameboys, there’s no coming out, no disclosure, because it’s not necessary. It’s a love story, plain and simple.

This review may contain spoilers.

A story of love and acceptance even in the worst of times.

Story: I’m writing this as a lesbian who experienced the same events as Cairo within this drama as I can understand and appreciate the plot in a different way because of this. I also struggled with my sexuality the same as Cairo, and was outed when I was still not ready. I (like Cairo) was outed by my now ex best friend who I thought would accept me, but turned completely against me. Being outed by the person you thought was your best friend completely breaks your trust which explains why Cairo is so closed off. Dealing with the burden of such a huge secret weighs you down and having friends by your side is the most important thing you can have when you’re struggling with your own identity. The way Cai also handled it, accepting her apology but not forgiving her yet made me happy. When someone hurts you that much it’s almost impossible to go back to the way things were before, so I love that they didn’t make what his best friend did out to be a minor issue and showed the consequences of her actions both for him and her. The slow but quick progress of their relationship was fast but also felt quite natural in some ways. When they finally met you could see so much love in their eyes I actually teared up when I saw them crying. This was not just a story about a simple internet romance during the Covid-19 pandemic, this is a story of love and acceptance even in the worst of times.

Cast: Elijah Canlas as Cairo- At first I did think Elijah’s acting was a little awkward but as the series progressed we saw an actor who took on a role giving it his own interpretation and completely taking on the role of Cairo. It wasn’t even the big things, but the most subtle actions made his role so believable. When I first realised I was interested in woman the term ‘gay’ or ‘lesbian’ felt so foreign, so when I finally confronted my sexual preference I remember getting choked up and it took me a few seconds to even say the word ‘gay’. When Cairo did the same when talking to his mum I had to pause the episode and breath because of how emotional I felt. I can officially say that Elijah as Cairo is the best actor to have played such a role in order to represent the fear those of the LGBT community still face even to this day. When he portrayed his father dying, it wasn’t the case of quickly moving on, but it also wasn’t portrayed as him being constantly depressed, it was more he was sad but wanted to continue living his life and carrying on his father’s memory which I loved.
—Kokoy de Santos as Gavreel- Kokoy created a character for Gavreel that was more than just the simple playboy he may seem on the outside. He created a confident but secretly insecure character who always wanted the people around him to be happy. He was a character that was pushy in some ways, but also understood when Cairo needed space and would back off but still show and send his love and support throughout all the tough times he faced. Gavreel was also just as prone to jealousy as anyone would be, and although he clearly struggles to communicate he does try and we watch him grow through the series.I really loved the character of Gavreel and I think describing him as “boyfriend goals” would be especially fitting.
—Adrianna So as Pearl- Wow, Pearl was literally my favourite female character not just in this series, but possibly ever. She was the shipper female friend that was there for the couple, defended them, but also knew when not to interfere with their love lives. She had a strong sense of right and wrong and would even argue with her best friend on Cairo’s behalf if she thought he did something wrong. My favourite quote of hers is “if you did something stupid don’t use mental health as an excuse, own up to your mistakes make up for it and don’t do it again”. She even drove all the way out to help Gav and Cai meet for the first time, and left as soon as they were together so they had chance to be alone as if she knew how important this meeting was. She’s someone that seems like she would be easy to make friends with and talk to when you go through tough times. I can’t wait to watch her own series when it comes out.

Music: It was pretty enjoyable with some good backtracks and sound effects, but nothing I thought was incredibly memorable.

Rewatch value: I can definitely say as soon as this series ends I’ll straight away be rewatching it, and I can imagine that I’ll go back to this series many times.

Overall: I’m so grateful for this series and I believe this series alone will help so many people in Cairo’s position. This is more than just a simple BL series and I can’t thank The IdeaFirst company enough for creating this. This will definitely be a game changer, not only for Filipino BL’s, but the representation of gay characters as a whole. I’m so glad I was able to watch this series when it first began.

FANTASTIC
Story
The story was fantastic showing the struggles of mental illness and love. It really had an amazing and smooth flowing plot. I loved the chemistry the girls have and that the love didn't feel forced or quick. I also LOVED the diversity with all the characters and how they portrayed all the minorities in a lovely way.

Acting/Cast
I only gave it 9.5 because there were some points that the acting felt a little over the top but it wasn't really with the main cast ever.

Music
I don't really recall anything special with the music besides when the main character sang (which was beautiful). However I do enjoy sometime subtle background music. I also loved the intro song too.

Overall
The only reason I won't rewatch it often is because I want it to be fresh every time I watch it. The show is fantastic and I really recommend watching it because it is amazing and well written.

A review by TSG98 (MyDramaList):

""Web Series Review: Chasing Sunsets (2020)""
Filmed during the quarantine lockdown in the Philippines, Chasing Sunsets is a web series centered on interconnected stories of hope, love, and survival. Amidst the public health crisis, the Camp Avenue Studios spearheaded the project with an end in mind: the end goal is to offer the viewers a different type of series that intertwines entertainment and awareness. The underlying themes in the series which are indicated at the introduction of ten episodes discuss pressing issues such as mental health problem, the sensitive topic of rape victim, and the fear of acquiring HIV. I commend the actors who seem new and amateur in the field of acting. They pulled it off! One surprising perspective the series tackles is the importance of companionship. The case of Lara who is diagnosed of depression and anxiety becomes the principal victim of her mental disorders. She met later on the owner of the campsite who happens to be openly lesbian and a proud mom of her beautiful daughter. They formed a friendship but shortly after got entangled in a platonic relationship. The ending might surprise the viewers but I guarantee you it takes you to a whole level: a roller coaster of emotions.

Did it meet my expectations? Yes! I was thrilled to see a series so relevant in this day and age. As I always say, the audience must be wise enough to prefer movies and series that provide them life lessons over some films that only satiate their thirst for temporary happiness.

ser006,Gaya-sa-Pelikula.jpg,,,Gaya sa Pelikula,"Jaime ""JP"" Habac, Jr.",2020-09-25,"A review by Sunstar:

Have you ever watched a TV show or film and said to yourself, “I feel seen?” Globe Studios’ “Gaya Sa Pelikula” (“Like In The Movies”) aims to take back the story of the queer community and put pure young love at the forefront—it’s the love story we deserve to see.

In this web series directed by JP Habac and created and written by Juan Miguel Severo, architecture student Karl (Paolo Pangilinan) spends the semester break in his uncle’s condo while working as an online ghost writer to pay his dues. There, he meets Vlad (Ian Pangilinan), a film major and his next door neighbor who accidentally trespasses in his unit.

Although production was done amid quarantine, the story takes place in December 2018, making it a welcome reprieve from the pandemic-themed shows we’ve been seeing a lot lately. As the title suggests, “Gaya Sa Pelikula” pays tribute to several classic Filipino movies.

You can check out director JP Habac’s Instagram account for all the movie references made in the show.

Watching the first half of the series, “Gaya Sa Pelikula” seems to tick all the boxes one looks for in the boys’ love (BL) genre: two charming leads with palpable chemistry, a memorable meet-cute, endearing supporting characters, the works. But as the show picks up mid-season, it becomes so much more than just a tale of young budding love, but also a timely discussion on identity, family, allyship and social issues.

It’s important to point out the show’s unabashed effort to unpack and tackle microaggressions toward the queer community. Throughout the series, Vlad, who is openly gay, calls Karl out on several occasions like when he gestured with a limp wrist to ask if Vlad was gay and being reluctant to say the word “gay” as if it’s some kind of insult when it’s not, or saying “In fairness ha, hindi ka halata (In fairness, you’re not that obvious)” referring to Vlad’s gender expression as if it was a compliment. The show is filled with teachable moments that its viewers can learn from.

With the deluge of BL shows nowadays, it’s easy to put “Gaya Sa Pelikula” in that box. But while most BL shows (and rom-coms, in general) tend to tread the fan-serving, cookie-cutter “happy-ever-after” route, “Gaya Sa Pelikula” subverts the tried-and-tested tropes of the genre and makes something more out of the show: a social statement, a cultural impact on media, and representation of the queer community. It’s a universal and timeless story of love.

One noteworthy aspect of the show is the narrative arc of Karl. Contrary to the title, “Gaya Sa Pelikula” turns out to be not like the movies after all, at least not in the way you’d think. (Sorry, tiny spoiler!) More than finding romance, the lead finds love and acceptance in himself. The show goes for authenticity over fantasy and culminates in probably the most profound way.

Ultimately, “Gaya Sa Pelikula” is a slice of life, a beautiful, tender part of it. As it premiered on Netflix last month, “Gaya Sa Pelikula” is the second Pinoy BL series to be on the streaming platform following “Gameboys,” proving that it’s high time that these kinds of stories were told, seen and heard; that after all, boys’ love is, in fact, no different than any other kind of love—and as cliché as it sounds, love is love.

Ben X Jim (2020): A Well-Made Pinoy BL Series

“Ben X Jim” was a well-made Filipino (Pinoy) boys’ love (BL) series. There were a few missteps in terms of characterizations of the support characters but with regard to acting performance and production technicals, this series was very good.

Those who have had a crush on their childhood friend but weren’t able to confess their feelings will find this series relatable. “Ben X Jim” employed the childhood friends to lovers trope that banks heavily on beliefs about destiny and stars aligning when the time is right. Ben and Jim have history together and this series was about confronting their past in order to navigate through their present and their future. Ben and Jim were flawed characters. Ben was abused in a relationship and was prone to dependency. He was also self-righteous at times. Jim wasn’t politically correct and he was macho and possessive at times especially when he constantly referred to Ben as “wifey.” But what’s good with these characters, they’re self-aware of their flaws and towards the end, there were clear character developments. Unfortunately, this can’t be said of most of the support characters. While Leo had more than enough character background and development, Flo, Olan, and Yana didn’t. In fact, even with all the apologies, I’d still say Olan and Yan were treated badly.

On the plus side, screenplay was consistently realistic and relatable. There were good heartfelt lines as well as hilarious dialogues. Ben and Jim’s dramatic scenes had good serious lines while Ben and Olan’s comedic scenes had good funny dialogues. Script was also able to seamlessly incorporate the characteristics of fictional Pinoy superheroes Captain Barbel and Darna and the struggles of real Pinoy modern-day heroes like our frontliners (small business owners, essential workers, couriers, etc.) in one episode.

Across the board, acting was quite solid. Both Teejay and Jerome were very good. They didn’t overact. Their emotional delivery per scene was just fine. They had chemistry together. It also helped that both are quite good-looking. All the male cast members were gorgeous (with a couple of shirtless scenes, lol). Johannes is the beautiful bad boy while Ron is the charming naughty guy. Both of them capitalized on the scenes given to them with appropriate performances. All the female cast members gave good performances as well. It’s really a pity their characters weren’t fully developed.

It wasn’t surprising that “Ben X Jim” had strong production technicals. Regal Entertainment Inc., a major film production company in the Philippines, produced this series. Production design, cinematography, sound engineering, musical scoring, and editing were unfailing. The soundtrack “Stars Align” by Sam Marquez featuring Swavesound was ok but it was a bit overplayed throughout the series.

All in all, I would definitely recommend rewatching “Ben X Jim.” If you’re looking for a well-made Pinoy BL series with outstanding acting performance and production technicals, “Ben X Jim” is a suitable series for you. While “Ben X Jim” was from the point of view (POV) of Ben, it seems that its second season, “B X J Forever,” will be from the POV of Jim. The second season is definitely something to watch out for!

ser008,Pearl Next Door.jpg,,,Pearl Next Door (Web Series),Ivan Andrew Payawal,2020-10-23,"Web Series Wednesday – Pearl Next Door
By starrymag | December 23, 2020

WHY SHOULD I WATCH?

Pearl Next Door is a brand-new web series and a spin off of The Idea First Company’s previous hit, Gameboys. This new series follows Pearl (Adrianna So), a fun-loving breakout character from the parent show as she opens herself up to the idea of love and ends up getting much more than she originally bargained for. Iana Bernardez and Rachel Coates co-star as Karleen and Alex, vying for Pearl’s affection.

So makes Pearl charismatic and fun to watch that you can’t help but be drawn to her and naturally invested in her love life. Pearl is an avid vlogger and a big fan of pop culture. The character feels so genuinely real, like someone you already follow on social media.

Pearl Next Door is creatively shot, telling most of the story through video calls, vlogs and various status updates, which only makes it easier to connect with these characters. It’s like a dating show where you get to see the real unedited personalities of the contestants and you will end up picking someone to root for. It’s “The Bachelorette” meets “The Circle” with some TikTok in between and wildly entertaining.

The series also touches base on some tougher subjects in the LGBT+ dating world like people hiding behind the guise of preferences when it’s really rooted in fear and ignorance. The characters have a continued discussion about it and don’t shy away from calling one another out when they’re being narrow minded. It’s always good to see candid conversations in a show like this one as it keeps it realistic.

There are currently five episodes available to stream and the first segment of the three-part season finale is coming out this weekend. Each episode comes in around twenty minutes, like your typical sitcom, so there’s plenty of time to spend in this world. If you’re looking for WLW representation, you’re a fan of romantic comedies or you just love a fresh and new creative series to binge, give Pearl Next Door a try. And while you’re at it, check out Gameboys, too.

WHERE CAN I WATCH? Episodes are available on YouTube.

Brownie Reviews: Pearl Next Door | 08/23/21
From: https://aminoapps.com/c/lgbt-1/page/blog/brownie-reviews-pearl-next-door/aV15_RrMu0ueewGE3ZpgwXz8bm68pgXBVP1

This series is about a Bisexual girl named Pearl who is an influencer/youtuber. The majority of the story takes place through screens since it is mostly centered around dating during the pandemic. The two love interests of Pearl are Karleen (with long brown hair in the pictures) and Alex (with short reddish brown hair). This story takes an interesting approach to friendship, romance, biphobia and the queer community. Even the side story talks about important topics such as polyamory and monogamy.

Overall, this was an amazing series to watch! It was funny, romantic, interesting and brought a new perspective that many shows don’t usually bring especially since its set in 2020 and being under lockdown.

tw: biphobia, relationship trauma, mature topics

Age Rating: 16+

I think 16 and up would be the perfect audience for this show. Only because in one episode there is some talk of mature topics but besides that, this is a great show and a good representation of the Lesbian and Bisexual community. I think this show could be very relatable for many different people. It’s also a good start if you’re just getting into GL or would like to try watching one.

Star Rating: 8 out of 10

book001,Talong_Tahong_ Mga Kwentong Homoerotiko_Cover.jpeg,,,Talong/Tahong: Mga Kwentong Homoerotiko,Rolando B. Tolentino; Romulo P. Baquiran Jr.; Joi Barrios; Mykel Andrada,2011,"A review by renzo (Goodreads):

""para tayong mga ahas nag-iiwan ng balat tuwing nahahayok sa laman.""

Lagpas sa salitang libog ang mga kuwento sa koleksyong ito. Parang nanonood ako ng pornograpiya na punom-puno ng pag-ibig ang mga kasangkot. Napapakambiyo ako sa bawat ungol. Nanggagahasa ang mga salita at pangungusap. Nalalasahan ng dila ang lapot ng katas. Nanunuot sa kokote ang linamnam. Isang masarap na putahe ng homoerotikong mga kuwento na paulit-ulit mong titikman kapag nalasahan.

A review by K.D. Absolutely (Goodreads)

This book has been with me since 2011. I was only loaned to me by a lady physician friend. I am not sure why I agreed to borrow this. I thought I would have fun reading about same-sex stories. Yes, this anthology is about homosexual stories and the sexual acts are explicitly and graphically tackled or described. The first few ones are delightful, i.e., entertaining (haha no kidding!), but after reading the same thing (how many variations can a homosexual act have?), your sensitivities become jagged and you have no choice but pay attention to the writing and let go of the sex acts. Otherwise, you will not be able to finish the book.

Rolando B. Tolentino is currently a professor at the University of the Philippines Film Institute. He graduated with a degree in economics from De La Salle University. He is a visiting professor at the National University of Singapore's sociology department. He is a member of Manunuri ng Pelikulang Filipino. He is also a contributor to Criticine, an online journal dedicated to elevating discourse on Southeast Asian cinema. He pursued his masters in Philippine studies also at De La Salle. He earned his Ph.D. in film studies at the University of Southern California. He has written extensively on Philippine cinema, literature and popular culture.

So, Tolentino is not some kind of fluke whose main objective is to titillate gays, bisexuals or the adventurous straights, right? Yes. The stories in this anthology are nicely written: ""contained"" mood, consistent POV's, slices-of-""real""-life (real in quotation because I am not sure if these things happen in real life though) and has beginning-middle-end (thank you, Beverly, see? I learned from you). Also, Tolentino explained that the ""hero"" or the ""main protagonist"" in this anthology is the human body so these seem to be a glorification to human body as it is adored by a member of the same sex. Not sure if this sits well with you but I chose to read this so there.

As usual, I put my knee-jerk reactions after reading a story or a bunch of them below:

1) Mortal Kombat sa Shangri La. by Mykel Andrada - 3 STARS
The two young men are sitting inside the Santo Domingo Church. One of them is touching the other's crouch. Since they cannot do ""it"" inside the church, they go to the toilet. Gee, I go to that church on a weekly basis so I could picture what they were doing haha. There?

2) Neon ni Deo. by Romulo P. Baquiran, Jr. - 3 STARS
I have been to a gay bar but only for a bottle of beer and for a quick while just enough to witness one boy's dance wearing a short-short denims pants. He was holding a bottle of beer while gyrating. This was in 1994 before I got married. I was testing myself I being in a gay bar would change my mind haha.

3) Kuwento ni Jethro. by Kristian S. Cordero. - 3 STARS
One boy has not experience masturbation yet so he is invited by another boy (older than the first boy) to do it together. The boy falls in love with the older one. Unfortunately, the older one is straight.

4) Sa Odd Manila. by Faye Cura - 2 STARS
The first lesbian story and it is too short. No explicit sex scenes. Just some lamentations of a gay girl about a friend who is ignoring her.

5) M2M. by Paul G. Del Rosario - 3 STARS
About a plain-looking gay boy who is in love with another gay boy but this object of his fantasy is too showbiz star handsome. So, the plain gay boy does all the efforts in bed and when it is his turn to be happy, the handsome gay boy just sleeps and excuses himself to be tired. Sad but the way Del Rosario wrote this makes this story too heartfelt.

6) Notas intimas (o, aha, ayan ka na naman, nakakita ka lang ng nota'y hindi ka na naman mapakali, best in religion ka pa naman din noong bata ka). ni Vlad Gonzales - 2 STARS
Gonzales tried hard to make the story different by injecting humor and using a non-linear storytelling. But it just did not fly for me. Easily forgettable.

7) Lorenzo. by Chuckberry Pascual. - 3 STARS
Quite memorable. When the neighbor boy shouts ""Bakla!"" (Gay!), I thought it would just be ignored by the narrator, a gay boy who has to stop studying because his mother has no money to send him to school. The gay boy is religious but his new neighbor has just moved to that place and he is fond of sleeping with his room's window open while he is only wearing short-shorts in bed. I like gay boys who fight for those who oppressed them.

8) Ang Binatilyong Nalimot. by Louie Jon A. Santos - 1 STAR
A young man is doing a study on people who died in fire accidents. One day, he finds an article mentioning a name of a man who used to have sex with him when he was 12-y/o and that man was 14-y/o. I think this story suffered most because of its brevity. Somewhat ordinary if not pointless.

9) Kislot. by Mari M. Santiago - 2 STAR
The second lesbian love story in the collection. Also short but a bit better than #8. I did not know that lesbian young girls go for physical stuff also. I think this story could have been better if Santiago was more descriptive or brutal so that it goes with the style of the other authors.

10) Hasang. by John Iremil E. Teodoro - 1 STAR
Wait. This one is long and yet it is also ordinary. It tells the story of a 30-y/o medical representative in a pharmaceutical copy so he has to stay in the city. Then one day, he feels burned out so he resigns and looks for his former lover who is now residing in Camiguin, an island city in the Visayas. He finds out that the former lover is already married with 3 children. But wait, there is a good-looking fisherman living nearby, the 25-y/o Luis who has a set of gills. Oh yes, just like a fish!

11) A. (para kay jm). by Rolando B. Tolentino - 2 STAR
This is told by a first person narrator who frequents a gay bar and falls in love with a dancer/entertainer there. That relationship opens his eyes on the reality of being gay and the nature of the relationship that the man he loves might just be taking advantage of him. Nothing new, really but Tolentino's prose seems sincere and a bit stylish. This is my first time to read a book by him and this made me interested to find and read other works by him.

12) Pauline Angela Chavez. by Mylene Tordesillas - 3 STAR
The third lesbian story in the anthology and I liked it. It is told in a light yet very effective way. Not really original. I think I saw this style in Lina Flor's 1936 short story ""Five Snapshots.""
However, Tordesillas' style is more contemporary and fresh. I think she should write more.

13) Silid. by Camilo M. Villanueva, Jr. - 4 STARS
I enjoyed this. The gay angle is very subtle and something that you have to deduce from the first person narration that seems to be going nowhere. If only all gay writers write this way, I would read more and more gay literature. The ending is tragic or seems to be tragic. It's like a overblown lamentation of love and at first I could not figure it out until it dawned on me that Villanueva was just trying to express the sorrow the narrator was feeling. Very unconventional yet one of the best stories in this collection. Who is this author? I want to read more of his works.

14) Bangus. by Michael Jonathan A. Villar - 3 STARS
Two fitness trainers at the gym are lusting after a beautiful sexy client so they are watching and assisting her doing the exercises. There is also the homosexual TV personality Rey Pumaloy who is distracting one of the fitness trainer. After the work out the two trainers masturbate in the gym's toilet. They are not aware that Rey Pumaloy was also there... Not all out gay story because it does not have a homosexual act. The author knows how to control himself. I liked this!

15) Ang Tauhan Niyang si Emil. by Alvin B. Yapan - 4 STARS
Very different approach in storytelling. Yapan beautifully overextended some points but his mastery of prose allowed him to do this. He is really a joy to read (this is my 3rd time to encounter him). Like #14, this story has almost no homosexual elements. At least on the surface. Because the internal struggle (of coming out) is really bottled inside the main protagonist. Very different technique in storytelling yet very effective. For me, I guess.

Overall, still a nice book. It's just that I was not able to really relate to most of the stories. Too gross for me.

Thank you to Doctor Ranee for lending me this book!

A review by John Rey Dave (Goodreads):

May pagkakaiba ang erotika at pornograpiya. Orgasm ang layunin ng huli na nakakamit sa pamamagitan ng lantarang pagsasalarawan ng sex, at madalas na mayroong formula: magtatagpo ang magtatalik, maghuhubad, foreplay, magtatalik, at saka maghihiwalay. Samantala, sa tingin ko, ang tunguhin naman ng erotika ay (1) ang paggising sa pagnanasa (arousal) ng mambabasa habang (2) inuunawa ang relasyong sekswal-romantiko sa pagitan ng mga tauhan sa kwento. Dahil may dimensyong homoerotiko, i.e. queer, ang mga kwento, ang layunin nito at tulungan ang mambabasa na unawain ang mga relasyong same-sex. Kung nasapul ng isang kwento ang dalawang bagay na ito, sa tingin ko’y tagumpay na erotika ang kwento.

Nakamit ng ilang mga kwento sa “Talong/Tahong” ang layuning ito. Pinakagusto ko ang: (1) “Lazaro” ni Chuckberry Pascual dahil sa paghahalo ng imahen ng rosaryo (relihiyon) at ng ari ng lalaki; (2) “Hasang” ni John Iremil Teodoro kung saan mababasa ang pagkahulog ng loob ng dalawang lalaki sa isang paraiso; at (3) “Kislot” ni Mari Santiago kung saan inaalala ng isang babae ang kanyang mga nakarelasyong babae noon, habang nililikot siya sa kasalukuyan ni Steve (isang madalang na pagkakataong makababasa ng bisexual na tauhan sa Filipino). Mayroon din namang mga kwentong hindi gaanong katagumpay sa una o ikalawang layunin, kung saan nagkulang o sumobra sa pareho.

Sa lipunang gaya ng atin, itinatago ng mga queer ang kanilang pagnanasa sa katawan, relasyon, at sa pag-ibig na ipinagbabawal at itinuturing na kasalanan at imoral. Awtomatiko na sa mga akdang queer ang pagtunggali sa heteronormative na pananaw sa kasarian, pero siguro’y pinakamapangahas ang erotika dahil itong pagnanasa sa katawan ng kapwa-lalaki, kapwa-babae, at sa mga kasariang hindi pasok sa heteronormativong pag-iisip, ang isang bagay na gugustuhin nilang itago na lama g sa halip na lantarang dinadakila at ipinagdiriwang.

book002,Ang Ikaklit Sa Aming Hardin.jpg,,,Ang Ikaklit Sa Aming Hardin,Bernadette Neri,2012,"A review by Biena (The Library Mistress):

More than the issue of gender and society, this book of few pages will teach us the real definition of home.

A review by Mikee Jay: 
This book done an excellent job in delivering and explaining a sensitive topic to the children. This book is very good in educating the children regarding societal norms of a family. The story touched the innocence of a kid on what is a ""normal"" family. The symbolism of ""Ikaklit"" is very meaningful. I highly recommend this book to teachers, librarians, and parents when it comes to discussing sensitive topic to children.
 
A review by Charlie:
Simple yet timely and engaging – Ikaklit sa Aming Hardin is perfect as a tool to teach children about the value of family, no matter how different it is from the common standard.
When I got invited to participate in the blog tour for Ikaklit sa Aming Hardin, I thought it would be just another typical children’s picture book. Since I have a seven-year old younger brother, I immediately agreed. Little did I know what a gem would it be to read Ikaklit sa Aming Hardin!
The storyline and prose was simple, which is perfect for young readers. My younger brother had no trouble following the Filipino texts, and if he had something to clarify, he would turn to read the English translations included in the book. I really appreciate the English translations because foreign readers would also be able to understand the message which the book conveys. Also, personally, I’m not so good with Filipino. This stems largely due to the fact that I am from Iloilo. The dialect here is different, and the medium of instruction is English. There is hardly any need to speak Filipino, so as much as I hate to admit it, some Filipino words baffle me. This is why when I was reading the book, the English translations were really helpful.
As for the subject of the story, as I’ve said, I find it really timely. And I agree with the message of the story: there is a need for a new definition for the word ‘family’. Considering the emergence of same-sex relationships, not all families are composed of the typical father, mother and children anymore. Besides, no matter how much most people ridicule same-sex relationships, the fact is that they exist, and they are capable of love just as much as any person.
Another thing I really appreciate about the story is the parallelism of a family and a flower garden. It doesn’t really matter who planted the seeds, what matters is who took time and effort to groom, nurture and love the plants and flowers. This message was really powerful and it resonated with me when I was reading the story.
The pictures were really attractive, too. They were colorful and eye-catching, and pretty! My brother and I couldn’t stop looking at the pictures even after we finished reading. When I found out that the illustrator was CJ De Silva, I wasn’t surprised. I recognized here from the milk advertisement from the 90’s, and I found it really nice that she still paints.
All in all, Ikaklit sa Aming Hardin is a gem. It’s both educational and gender-sensitive, and it’s perfect for teaching children about the value of family.

book003,Ang Bonggang Bonggang Batang Beki.jpeg,,,Ang Bonggang Bonggang Batang Beki,Rhandee Garlitos,2013,"A review by Phoebe Andamo:

Bet na bet ni watashi itechiwa! Havey na havey ang kwento, keriboomboom. Wachikelibambam ang mga nyeyters nitey. Opkors purita kalaw, waley datungshi ang mga nyeyters ng mga batang beki.

Some of my friends are from the LGBT community and most of them are those whom I really trust. I did not, however, learn the gay lingo from my friends (they're not using it). I remembered it from watching few videos of Bern Josep Persia also known as Bekimon. As you can see, I attempted and failed to review in gay lingo (maybe I'll get there somehow someday haha).

This is the first children's book in Asia that tackles effiminacy on boys. (Sorry, I should've not use 'homosexuality' as it might be misleading because it doesn't involve attraction on the same sex).

The story is narrated in the eyes of an innocent child. His younger brother Adel is effeminate and likes the color pink. Their uncle and cousins tease and bully Adel all the time but his family is always defending him. In the end, he shows that he can also defend himself.

This is an eye opener for people like Tito Braulio, those who are close-minded, uptight, and radical conservatives. Parents are very influential to their children. So if Tito Braulio will be sympathetic, he can teach his children what is being kind and what is not. If he, however, can't distinguish it himself, how can he teach his own children? Those children will be the next generation so it's better if more people will have an open mind.

I like how Adel's family is open minded. They accept him in everything he does and what he likes. His father is understanding; he does not care that Adel will not acquire the traditional qualities that man possess. His older brother and sister are also supportive. They don't see him as different and with fault.

The story also shows that sexuality does not affect the productivity, the character, and the wholeness of a person.

A review by Judie:
A great buy from the National Children's Book Day fair! It is brimming with respect, acceptance, and a family's love. It teaches the importance of accepting a person for whatever he or she is. Great illustrations, too.

book004,Travelbook by Shane Carreon.jpg,,,Travelbook,Shane Carreon,2013,"Travelbook: Poems by Shane Carreon
From: https://averynicemess.wordpress.com/2015/01/30/travelbook-poems-by-shane-carreon/

I’ve first encountered Shane Carreon when I was following the updates of the 52nd UP National Writers Workshop, of which she was a fellow. An essay on her poetics was posted, but I never got to finish reading it. So when I saw her poetry book in Powerbooks Shangri-La, I knew I had to get a copy.

The book’s contents is split in two: the first half contains her poetry while the other is her essay on her poetics (which I’m not sure is the same as the one I read before). The book’s introduction is by Merlie Alunan, Carreon’s mentor.

There are a few poems in Travelbook that really stand out among the others. My favorites are “the mice,” “Pulang Bato,” “Visits to Your Father,” and “A New.” Upon reading, those that come after “the mice” seemed to be more appealing to me. Carreon’s poetry greatly captures the stillness of many things, and a gentle voice is heard in these poems. As for the essay, it seemed like a review of the lessons on lit that I took in college, but it is enlightening nonetheless as it gives us a view of Carreon’s writing process.

Travelbook is a valuable contribution to Philippine lesbian literature, which is still in short supply. It’s also nice to hear newer voices in Philippine lit.

book005,Ang Autobiografia ng Ibang Lady Gaga_Cover.jpeg,,,Ang Autobiografia ng Ibang Lady Gaga,Stefani J. Alvarez,2015,"A review by K.D. Absolutely:

Ang ibig sabihin ng dalawang bituin sa Goodreads ay ""It's okay."" Hindi ko nagustuhan pero hindi rin naman ayaw.

Hindi ko masisisi kung maraming nagkagusto o magkakagusto sa aklat na ito. Mahusay naman ang pagkakabalangkas ng libro. Masining ang pagkakalahad ng siyamnapu't isang dagli. Interesante ang paksa: mga karanasan ng manunulat na OFW na si Jack Alvarez sa Saudi Arabia bilang Administrative Assistant sa isang petrochemical na planta roon.

Artistiko rin rin pabalat. Ang mga pinagbali-baliktad na mga titulo at ang wasak-wasak na imahe ni Lady Gaga ay parang simbolo ng magulong mundong ginagalawan ni Jack Alvarez. Magulo hindi dahil sa gusto niyang ayusin. Magulo dahil magulo rin siya talagang mag-isip: ang papalit-palit na mga kasintahang Arabo, ang pagtakas sa mga suliraning kinakaharap, ang di pagsagot sa nagri-ring na cellphone, ang ugaling Pinoy (sabi ng expat namin sa opisina) na pagtulog o pagpapalibang aksyunan ang isang suliranin sa pag-asang magkakaroon ng isang dahilan para hindi mapilitang harapin o solusyunan ito.

Ibig sabihin ko lang, oo nga't masining ang aklat ayon sa porma't konteksto nito. Oo nga't nakakalungkot ang pinagdaraanan ni Jack Alvarez. Pero bakit? Hindi natin kasi dapat laging isipin na biktima lang tayo ng kahirapan. Dahil inabandona tayo ng ating ama, hanggang sa dulo'y hindi natin magawang magpatawad? Mananatili ba tayong kakaawaan ang sarili natin na magiging paraan para hindi nating pilitin ibahin ang takbo ng buhay natin? At habang buhay natin isisisi sa ating mga magulang kung bakit ito lang tayo? Magpapalit-palit ng mga kasuyong Arabo para lang napunan ang nawalang father figure o payagang mababoy ang sarili para lang sa salapi>? Ganoon maaari tayong tumakas? Ganoon alam natin na may magagawa tayo?

Saludo ako sa mga aklat na nagpapakita ng tunay na mga pangyayari. Mga pangyayaring nagsasalamin sa kung ano ang pinagdadaanan ng mga Pilipino noong unang panahon man o sa kasalukuyan. Kung walang magsusulat ng mga suliranin natin, hindi ito malalaman ng maraming tao. Walang magiging kamulatan. Kaso lang, iniisip ko, dapat din nating isipin ang epekto ng poverty porn na porma ng literatura sa kamalayan ng magbabasa o hindi man ng buong bansa.

Hindi tayo nasakop ng mga dayuhan noong mga ilang daang taon para lamang isipin na ganito pa rin tayo noon, dahil ganoon tayo noon.

Ang ngayon ay hindi laging karugtong ng noon. 



A review by Orly Agawin:

One of my accidental buys from #MIBF2017. Met and chatted with the author with absolutely no idea what was in store in his book.

Started reading last night and I can't put it down. This collection of narrative snippets, written by a gay-OFW in the deserts of Saudi Arabia, sting wildly where it should hurt.

It is wild, direct, and heartbreaking without being too melodramatic.

Yes, we have heroes; though silent and distant. Keeping their hopes and love alive, despite the solitude and emptiness across the seas.

Love Jack’s stories. Love his style.

ANG AUTOBIOGRAFIA NG IBANG LADY GAGA is one anthology a Filipino reader should have. 

A review by Bomalabs: 

Kept me company for 2 straight hours on a Jeepney, again, as with the case of well-written books, I welcomed the the horrible traffic on my way home if only to finish it.

The book is written in Dagli form - stories too short to even be considered as short stories. These vignettes of the author's life as an OFW in Saudi Arabia perfectly encapsulates his significant moments, not necessarily in the order that it happened (if it was indeed autobiographical). For me, the arrangement of the stories: the family woes, the interspersing of romance and sexual Abuse with the routine of office life in a Petrochemical Plant and the lull of airconditioning mirrors the randomness and tragedy of life. And so, reading this, I got a sense of his life as a cohesive whole, however tragic it was - without a hint of melodrama, or preaching or an agenda that can be seen often in OFW themed writings. It is non-apologetic as the books' namesake, the always proud Lady Gaga. Save for its cover (haha sorry not a fan), it was a good read. But I sincerely hope the writer's okay - with everything that I've read.

book006,Riverrun_Cover.jpg,,,Riverrun,Danton Remoto,2015,"A review by Kiran Bhat:

Danilo Cruz, the protagonist of Danton Remoto’s Riverrun, is a young Filipino man raised near an American army base. From the get-go, something about Danilo is different, and everyone in his village can make it out. Even as a young boy, going to watch television at a friend’s house, the mother responds by slamming the door in his face. His reaction is violent.

“I walked down their cemented stairs, grabbed a pebble, no, a rock, and hurled it at their windowpane… The smashed window looked like the teeth of a shark.”

Danilo is too young to understand why people are alienated by him, but as he gets older, his being different takes a certain shape. He pines for his best friend Luis, imagining his “smooth skin and… face aureoled with light” every night he goes to bed. The labels—“you’re a fag, ha-ha-ha!” classmates shout—come before before he can fully understand that he is attracted to the same sex. His father observes that something in his gait is off. He advises Danilo:

“You should walk with your chest out, your stomach in and your gaze level in the distance… This is the way boys should walk.”
 
Ferdinand Marcos is meanwhile taking a stranglehold on the nation’s government. While Danilo and his family witness most events of the dictatorship from their television—the Plaza Miranda bombing, the suppression of student protests—violence soon comes to their remote village. A C-47 crashes into a nearby town. The family travels to the hospital. One family friend lays with his “khaki uniform… torn to shreds around the elbows and knees,” while another’s body is “limp, as if all of her bones had turned to water.”

Literary fiction from the Philippines rarely circulates abroad. The reimagining and republication of the 2015 Philippines edition of Remoto’s Riverrun by a publisher with international reach is therefore a welcome opportunity to experience a novel originating from the Philippines. The novel also succeeds as an honest portrayal of coming to terms with one’s sexuality. Most of the novel is filtered through Danilo’s attraction and arousal to various men, and his inability to understand what it means in regards to his place in society. No matter whether Danilo is in the rural Philippines, or in bustling London, where later Danilo heads to, there is the sense that Danilo will never understand himself. He remains in a state of emerging from his chrysalis, not only for the duration of the novel, but—one imagines—for the rest of his life.

The  novel is organized as a series of vignettes, with the writing pared down to resemble the drips of a faucet. We see Danilo grow, we stop, and then we observe him once more. Most of the vignettes remain told in first person, but some are structured as news articles, as lists, or as recipes. Some can almost stand their own complete short story. For example, Danilo’s first encounter with death come in the chapter “Sssssh”. It starts innocently enough, with young Danilo startled from hearing a “sssssh” in the trees; his family’s housewife Ludy explaining it as the movements of a Filipino folk monster, the kapre.

The kapre looks like a human being, except that it stands more than ten feet tall. In fact, it is as tall as the acacia tree in our yard. Its eyes are as big as saucers and its lips are as thick as the branch of a tree.
 
Danilo, aghast, refuses to stand near the acacia tree for many days. Ludy delights herself in telling more of these stories over the course of many days, feeding off the fear of a child. Then, the sound returns, this time accompanied by “six-by-six military trucks… transporting bodies in the night. The next day at church Danilo asks who it was that died. Ludy refuses to answer, and the “sssssh” sound returns, this time from Ludy’s own mouth.

The fragmented structure gives Remoto the opportunity to employ a heightened sense of observation, giving each and every moment a sense of daily detail that coming of age writing rarely achieves. As one finishes this this welcome addition to the growing library of gay coming of age novels, one has the impression of having lived life alongside Danilo.

A review by K.D. Absolutely (Goodreads):

I liked this book.

My second time to read a work by Representative Danton Remoto of the Ladlad Partylist that represents the marginalized LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) communities in the Philippines. Remoto is currently the producer and host of a top-rating, daily radio show called ""Remoto Control"" simulcast live on television, reaching millions of Filipinos every night. He has published books (poetry, collections, anthologies, etc) but this is his first novel.

The first book by Remoto that I read was his collection of poetry, Pulotgata: The Love Poems (1 star). I did not like it because I thought I was fooled. He did not reveal that the start what the poems were about homosexual love. I thought it was a deception since being gay might turn off some of the readers. But then towards the middle half of the collection, he had some poems with homosexual references and so I thought that the first ones were insincere.

Now that I know who Danton Remoto is and what he stands for, when I picked this book (the blurbs are very encouraging; there is even one by National Artist for Literature Nick Joaquin endorsing Remoto) I knew all along that there could be chapters or stories with homosexual nature.

The novel is another creative non-fiction. In form, it is a novel but it sounds and has the feel of being a memoir. Again, just like in Elmer Ordonez's Snows of Yesteryear: A Family in War and a Sentimental Education (5 stars), we don't know why it has to be categorized as novel when we know that it is true-to-life. Is it another deception so that the author can use creative license to put some elements of non-fiction in the otherwise boring life story? Is it so that relatives cannot sue them for telling lies? Is it another way to fool the readers? Why can't they be honest and sincere enough to tell the real stories?

Riverrun is a coming-of-age story of a gay boy in the Philippines during the 60's and 70's. Danton Remoto (born 1963) is just a year older than me so I was able to relate to most of his stories except of course the homosexual experiences. I did not lust after my boyhood male friend. I did not see a male penis except one night when adolescent boys were showing off their penises on a side street in Quezon while somebody is pointing a flashlight (torch) on his organ. I also had an older classmate Nombila showing his erect member during a school noon breaktime. No touching, no kissing, no whatsoever. Those boys in my hometown was just too horny, they'd like to show off.

But Remoto's way of telling his stories are poignant. The bittersweet language reminded me of Rene O. Villanueva's Personal: Mga Sanaysay sa Lupalop ng Gunita (4 stars) although Remoto used English language while Villanueva skillfully used Tagalog. They are both homosexuals (or so I was told) and there were scenes of men showing their members to either directly or unknowingly to the author. But Remoto is more explicit. Villanueva did not tell exactly that he lusted after his male friend(s) in the book. Maybe because Villanueva had his own family to protect so he did not come out by telling those kinds of stories in his well-read memoir.

A must read for all people who appreciate well-written gay boyhood stories.

book007,DontTellMyMother_BookCover.jpeg,,,Don't Tell My Mother,Brigitte Bautista,2017,"A review by K.J. CHARLES:

A coming of age f/f romance as a 19yo with a bullying religious mother comes to terms with her sexuality and falls in love with an older woman. (Who is a widow, was happily married, and is exploring her sexuality as much as our heroine.) It's passionately told and felt, as much about Sam's need to escape her stifling life and recognise how abusive her mother is as about the love story, though that is adorable (closed door love scenes). Also, lovely to see that Clara is the catalyst for her escape but Sam very definitely does it for herself.

Written in present tense, and I can't for the life of me see why because it made the flashbacks confusing. May this trend end soon. Otherwise I liked this a lot.


A review by JEANINE CARSTAIRS:

Don't Tell my Mother was an okay read. It's interesting at first because it tackles the struggles of a lesbian teenager hiding 'her true self'. I had a hard time adjusting to the writing because the style was a bit confusing for me. The first parts were okay but the story started going downhill somewhere in the middle. There were also a lot of unnecessary flashbacks. I wish I saw more of Sam and Christina's friendship and what they used to be instead. It's quite disappointing that the ending left me saying, ""that's it?""


A review by JAY TRIA:

Stellar, sharp writing. Prose so hilarious it brought me to the edge of tears so many times, both tears of joy and tears of aching lament. Characters so tangible I felt I could reach out and touch them, play chess with them, eat their chicken gallantina. Bautista is another author added to my auto-buy list.

book008,Bagay Tayo by Jerry Gracio.jpg,,,Bagay Tayo,Jerry Gracio,August 2018,"Bagay Tayo by Jerry B. Gracio: A Book Review
July 11, 2020
From: https://theapostatebookbore.wordpress.com/2020/07/11/bagay-tayo-by-jerry-b-gracio/

Bagay Tayo means if I translate it into English is we are made for each other.

I have learned that “straight men” can never fall in love with the same sex. The logic is men are psychologically inculcated in that they are sexually driven for women. Men are not attracted to men but only to women. If they are attracted to both men and women, they are bisexual. If they are only attracted to the same sex, they are homosexual. If they are only attracted to men because they feel that they are women, they must be transsexual. So, in case of sir Pitbull , a “straight man” who fell in love with writer sir Jerry Gracio, he must be bisexual; apparently, he also had “sexual relationships” with two women. However, Pitbull has never questioned his sexuality although Jerry sometimes asks him whether he is gay or not. He always retorts that Jerry is his wife and he loves him.

That is why I was romantically exhilarated. I never imagined that a “straight man” can fall in love with a gay. For me, it is a special case because it is a stereotype that “straight men” are after money. Nevertheless, in case of sir Jerry’s partner Pitbull, he seems to be every inch a man. Sir Jerry describes him as a “basagulero” or someone who always engages in a fight. His language is vulgar, typical of street men or “mga tambay” who are reputed to be troublesome, fractious, and hostile. However, Pitbull has never been ashamed of his relationship. He is open to his family and friends about it. He is proud to tell the world that Jerry is his wife and he loves him so much. So, that is what makes me confused: Is Pitbull straight or bisexual?

Perhaps the best logic here is that a man who has manly characteristics like above doesn’t necessarily mean that he is gay or he is gay because his environments such as his family particularly if his father is martian, peers, or other factors alike taught him manly characteristics. So, I stick to my belief in the context of psychology that Pitbull belongs to a different sex label after all. I strongly believe that a ” straight man” can change his sexual preference because he can learn to choose it psychologically. That is why I disagree to sir Jerry’s opinion that homosexuality is not contagious. It is in effect. And the best word to describe that is ” acquired” since the word “contagious” can have a negative connotation.

Sir Jerry Gracio met Pitbull in a movie theater. He was a stowaway. He left their province at a young age because his mom almost slit his neck with a bolo for leaving the house all the time. Lakwantsero. He was such a handful. When Jerry met him, he was like a greased tramp. He let him sleep at his house provided that he accompanied him in his lonely life for two years. What an audacious man! And the rest is the history of how they were able to make it to 13 years.

Since it is a gay story, of course, I found his love story romantic. Perhaps, it is the impact on me, for ” a straight man ” is also my sexual preference. I’m still delusional, of course. But as I have said, one’s sexual preference can be changed psychologically. There is still hope for us, mga bekis.

The story is as colorful as a rainbow, a symbol of #pride. It tells the real life of gays in a society that a same-sex marriage or relationship is not yet tolerated and what happens when a couple , especially if one of them is “straight”, lives together openly. Fortunately, sir Jerry’s hair is so long that his love life has never been disapproved of by their families,except by sir Jerry’s family side when Pitbull became his boyfriend; his parents had high standards of what man their son should meet . However, like typical of “real’ married couples, his story also shows that gay couples can go through a lot of challenges. For examples, he could also sail on two rivers. It was not that because he is bisexually bigamous in nature; his faithfulness was tested. Then, he had financial problems that Jerry himself resolved, a typical scenario I had expected; men are supposed to be the provider in a relationship given that I hate this social norm. Besides, both of them are men. Sir Jerry is the soft one. Hmm. Whatever! This norm should fall into abeyance.

The story also tells our stupidities of love. Sir Jerry is also like women ( because women are usually the victims of broken relationships) that you can be blind to love, that you are willing to stand the absurd shortcomings of the man you love. And it would be glorious when at last that man realizes all the sacrifices you have made for him. That was what actually happened to sir Pitbull. Indeed, sir Jerry’s hair is as long as Rapunzel’s.

Sir Jerry is a TV and film writer. No wonder he told his stories elegantly. The kind of language he used is both intellectual and colloquial which made his readers, especially us “bekis” relate to him. The tone is like he is talking to an ordinary person. Maybe because he is an activist and a socialism advocate. Still, the prose is meticulous, well-structured , and ryhming since he is a poet too. The words and phrases he used are even unfamiliar but comprehensible, implying his deep nationalism and love for our very own language. Consequently, I enjoyed reading the book seamlessly. I laughed a lot because both sir Jerry and his partner sir Pitbull are absolutely hilarious . I cringed a few times because their dialogues are romantic. I was tearful because sir Jerry is a good person and partner.

I was merely disappointed with its ending because it does not tell about Pitbull’s release from prison; the last parts are all about working on his case. I tried to check sir Jerry’s personal Facebook and was relieved that sir Pitbull is now free and as usual they are back to relive the romance they have shared through the years since both of them are now getting along in years.

Thanks to sir Jerry for sharing its free pdf copy on Twitter. But I will buy its hardbound and read it again because it is now one of my favorite gay stories. I will align it with Out of Doors by Ernesto Superal Yee, my another favorite Filipino gay story. I hope there is a sequel.

  “As long as there is love, there is hope.” – Love of Siam, 2007-

My rating: 4/ 5 stars ( I really liked it.)

A Review by K.D. Absolutely:

Can a straight man fall in love with a gay man? This CNF (creative non-fiction) book of Jerry B. Gracio says yes. And he has his real life experience, that the book recounts, to prove it. Not only that, when my book club interviewed him last year for this book, his husband was there beside him to answer our questions. And the husband looked every inch a man.

The book is a mind changer. Most of the same-sex relationship that I know are anchored in money. The gay man gives the financial needs of the straight man while the straight man, his body. But this one is different. Jerry Gracio is a professor, a popular movie scriptwriter, author and a poet. His husband drives a tricycle and so he is not totally dependent on Jerry. They first met when the husband, who was then a young man, ran away from home in the province because he was being maltreated by his parent (if I can still recall the book correctly). Jerry took pity on the young man and offered him his home. Then they fell in love with each other.

Being a prodigious poet and scriptwriter, Jerry Gracio's writing is meticulous and exact. He knows how to draw out emotions from his readers. The dialogues between him and his husband have that cinematic flavor. I guess that aside from the real events being all plausible, their exchanges (most of the time when they are alone) of those romantic but realistic lines make all the telling credible.

I recommend this book to all those you still doubt that a straight man can fall in love, truly deeply in love, with a gay man. After all, like what the fox says to the Little Prince: ""It is through the heart that one can see clearly... what is essential is invisible to the eyes.""

Jerry Gracio’s Bagay Tayo
By Marianne Melinda Lalap | Apr 30, 2021
From: https://malalap.medium.com/jerry-gracios-bagay-tayo-29164292a871

Love knows no bounds! It is what you may feel when you read the text written by Jerry Gracio, “Bagay Tayo”. “Love at First Sight”, “Kuwento”, and “Pitbull” are just parts of the story collection of Gracio. But even though I’ve only read the three excerpts, and with a subjective approach, it created a picture where you can visualize and understand their story. It became an open book where there are a lot of readers who are enjoying the progress of each chapter of their story.

Chapter 1: “Love at First Sight”
“HINDI AKO NANINIWALA DATI SA LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT, kahit na sinasabi ni Shakespeare na “Whoever loves, loves at first sight.”

He said that he never believed in love at first sight until he met Pitbull. They talked and talked and he fell in love with his story. Not only his story, but with the person also.

Chapter 2: “Kuwento”
NAGSISIMULA ANG PAG-IBIG SA KUWENTO, nabubuo sa pagitan ng mga kuwentuhan.

He emphasized how conversations and stories can grow your relationship. “Pero gano’n naman talaga ang kuwento — hinuhúli táyo para hindi bumitaw.”

Chapter 3: “Pitbull”
RAYMOND BERNABE REÑA TALAGA ANG PANGALAN NI PITBULL.

He revealed the real name of Pitbull, his lover. He explained why Raymond’s name became Pitbull because of his brother. For Jerry, this kind of love is something unique and new. He didn’t expect for him to fall in love with Pitbull because he is not the typical guy Jerry falls in love with. It is where he also shared their fights and misunderstandings in a relationship. But at the end of the day, love wins.

The mood throughout the story is very light. His tone and voice was casual that helped it to be followed and absorbed easily by the readers. There was a mix of humor in it as a rhetorical device that made it more entertaining to read. Another is the use of metaphor where Jerry’s family described Raymond as a Pitbull. He was not hesitant and wholly revealed very concrete details and pieces from his life. Jerry used a first person point of view which was effective for it became conversational like he is just narrating their story in MMK. Each of the excerpts started with a catchy line and ended with an emotional takeaway or realizations. He also used a flashback structure where he goes back to the memories they’ve had. At the end, we can consider this story as a whole memoir of their love story.

From the title itself, “Bagay Tayo”, Jerry makes sense of that whatever the odds are, they are for each other. Their love can not be tainted. According to my research, there was a time that they had to be separated because Pitbull was imprisoned. Long distance relationships are really hard but they said that they made it work. Even their differences make them bagay.

Personally, I’ve learned so much about love in Jerry’s story. Love is beautiful especially when you experience these kinds of things. How love can be so unexpected. How love can be hard. How love can change a person. How love moves in mysterious ways… and can be cheesy. This book is in my to-read list now.

book009,YouMeUs_Cover.jpg,,,"You, Me, U.S.",Brigitte Bautista,2020,"Review by K.J. CHARLES:

A really striking f/f romance set in the seedy side of Manila. Shop assistant Liza is desperate for a green card marriage to get her and, crucially, her family, to the US, and is on her fifteenth online boyfriend accordingly. Her best friend Jo is a failed singer turned sex worker. They are scrabbling to make ends meet, living lives that grind them down. Then Liza finally snags a sincere American man who flies over to meet and treat her, and quickly proposes. And suddenly things start to shift as Liza and Jo slowly face up to their desire and love for each other.

It's exquisitely done. The yearning and fear are palpable and compelling, conveyed with some haunting lines: I read this novella in a single sitting because I was completely submerged in the atmosphere and the women's story.

The conflict is as real as it gets. Liza's fiance is a perfectly decent man who is willing to give her and her family, including younger brothers, a life far in excess of anything they could hope for in Manila. This is not a trivial or easy choice to be made on the basis of glib moralising about true love: it's a horrible bind for both women. Jo has never risked offering herself, rather than her body, to anyone; Liza has been seeking the dream of escape and overseas comfort and safety all her life.

The characters do not behave in your standard romance manner (a reminder of how puritanical a lot of romance is, with definitions of 'cheating' that sometimes seem to include ever having sex with anyone but your fated mate). Liza sleeps with her American while grappling with her feelings for Jo; Jo has both paid and for-fun sexual encounters ditto; the book is completely nonjudgemental of this, emphasising women's right to do what they want with their bodies.

This is a sometimes seedy, painfully realistic romance with people who have cheap highlights and smoke and drink till they throw up and don't look good in the morning, and the book is all the stronger for it. It's one of the most intensely real-feeling romances I've read, with powerfully absorbing atmosphere and emotion. (And, I should say, it isn't depressing, despite the often sordid setting and problems. This one shows love blossoming where it takes root, not just in the luxury homes of billionaires.)

I had an ARC copy from the author. There are a few editing issues, which I found trivial in the context of how much I liked this.


Review by Geri Reads:

This one really hit the spot. There were so many things that resonated with me. From its Manila setting, the harsh reality of the ""American Dream"" and of the characters and their struggles.

I'd say it's part romance, part coming of age story between 2 best friends: Jo & Liza as they each navigate their lives and confront their growing feelings for each other.

Set in Manila, Philippines this book further proves that the world is sleeping on books written by Filipino authors. I highly recommend everyone to follow the #romanceclass tag on Twitter and Instagram for more books like this.
